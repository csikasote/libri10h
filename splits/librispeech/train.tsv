248-130652-0007.flac	GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH	15.055
248-130652-0008.flac	WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH	15.89

248-130652-0018.flac	LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS	15.975
248-130652-0019.flac	WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC	12.735
248-130652-0020.flac	YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION	12.04
248-130652-0021.flac	THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL	13.45
248-130652-0022.flac	AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER	14.53

248-130652-0028.flac	HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM	13.39
248-130652-0029.flac	LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE	15.365
248-130652-0030.flac	CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS	13.94
248-130652-0031.flac	IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT	13.925
248-130652-0032.flac	WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS	14.25
248-130652-0033.flac	AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION	15.025
248-130652-0034.flac	SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE	13.89
248-130652-0035.flac	AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT	10.665
248-130652-0036.flac	BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES	13.99
248-130652-0037.flac	LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT	14.165
248-130652-0038.flac	SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT	13.05
248-130652-0039.flac	AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING	5.69
248-130697-0000.flac	ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS	8.685
248-130697-0001.flac	DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS	11.225
248-130697-0002.flac	AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE	15.25
248-130697-0003.flac	AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION	16.2
248-130697-0004.flac	WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE	15.515
248-130697-0005.flac	AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE	13.675
248-130697-0006.flac	PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE	13.68
248-130697-0007.flac	BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY	13.945
248-130697-0008.flac	IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM	11.565
248-130697-0009.flac	THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS	13.395
248-130697-0010.flac	AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS	16.04
248-130697-0011.flac	SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE	16.06
248-130697-0012.flac	THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME	12.005
248-130697-0013.flac	BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL	15.265
248-130697-0014.flac	THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF	9.79
248-130697-0015.flac	IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA	13.065
248-130697-0016.flac	WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID	16.13
248-130697-0017.flac	I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN	14.085
248-130697-0018.flac	AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM	16.82
248-130697-0019.flac	WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE	14.755
248-130697-0020.flac	I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME	14.66
248-130697-0021.flac	IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS	12.875
248-130697-0022.flac	AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY	12.88
248-130697-0023.flac	TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID	12.01
248-130697-0024.flac	AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY	15.78
248-130697-0025.flac	NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS	10.75
248-130697-0026.flac	GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING	9.525
248-130697-0027.flac	OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT	12.6850625
248-130697-0028.flac	WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED	14.99
248-130697-0029.flac	BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW	13.79
248-130697-0030.flac	SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW	15.045
248-130697-0031.flac	DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING	13.13
248-130697-0032.flac	WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS	14.985
248-130697-0033.flac	YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE	4.605
248-130697-0034.flac	IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME	13.02
248-130697-0035.flac	HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT	11.555
248-130697-0036.flac	BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM	4.295
2514-149482-0010.flac	SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT	14.62
2514-149482-0011.flac	HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM	16.315
2514-149482-0012.flac	THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY	6.18
2514-149482-0013.flac	AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM	16.745
2514-149482-0014.flac	THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD	15.165
2514-149482-0015.flac	AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE	13.325
2514-149482-0016.flac	AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS	15.135
2514-149482-0017.flac	THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE	14.87
2514-149482-0018.flac	TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND	15.06
2514-149482-0019.flac	FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS	13.56
2514-149482-0020.flac	WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT	15.18
2514-149482-0021.flac	THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY	15.885
2514-149482-0022.flac	AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER	15.585
2514-149482-0023.flac	HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM	14.665
2514-149482-0024.flac	IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN	15.28
2514-149482-0025.flac	THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL	14.03
2514-149482-0026.flac	AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY	14.69
2514-149482-0027.flac	THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE	15.795
2514-149482-0028.flac	AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER	16.515
2514-149482-0029.flac	TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE	14.84
2514-149482-0030.flac	IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE	15.885
2514-149482-0031.flac	THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS	7.405
2514-149482-0032.flac	THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART	16.265
2514-149482-0033.flac	AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON	16.665
2514-149482-0034.flac	WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE	15.33
2514-149482-0035.flac	THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM	16.055
2514-149482-0036.flac	HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS	10.87
2514-149482-0037.flac	THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER	7.355

2514-149482-0044.flac	BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER	14.505
2514-149482-0045.flac	MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE	14.995

2514-149482-0056.flac	FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT	12.39
2514-149482-0057.flac	BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS	15.295
2514-149482-0058.flac	THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED	11.2

2514-149482-0060.flac	IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING	14.235
2514-149482-0061.flac	THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND	14.265
2514-149482-0062.flac	HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED	15.725
2514-149482-0063.flac	BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN	12.645
2514-149482-0064.flac	AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION	14.965

2514-149482-0068.flac	REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE	12.56
2514-149482-0069.flac	OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM	15.945
2514-149482-0070.flac	AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW	13.175
2514-149482-0071.flac	AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE	12.815
2514-149482-0072.flac	BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS	4.945

2514-149482-0075.flac	KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS	16.45
2514-149482-0076.flac	THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE	15.81
2514-149482-0077.flac	NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED	15.375
2514-149482-0078.flac	IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED	13.565
2514-149482-0079.flac	HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED	13.06
2514-149482-0080.flac	IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END	14.435
2514-149482-0081.flac	TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT	15.215
2514-149482-0082.flac	WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY	15.225
2514-149482-0083.flac	ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH	13.535
2514-149482-0084.flac	HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE	14.655
2514-149482-0085.flac	AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY	6.895
2514-149482-0086.flac	BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC	12.935
2514-149482-0087.flac	AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS	16.955
2514-149482-0088.flac	AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO	15.3

2514-149482-0093.flac	THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME	12.91
2514-149482-0094.flac	NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS	15.64
2514-149482-0095.flac	SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY	14.21
2514-149482-0096.flac	THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER	14.385
2514-149482-0097.flac	BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED	11.535
2514-149482-0098.flac	DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS	14.645
2514-149482-0099.flac	WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY	15.805
2514-149482-0100.flac	THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL	15.21
2514-149482-0101.flac	SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY	6.99
2514-149482-0102.flac	SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE	13.185
2514-149482-0103.flac	KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER	16.75
2514-149482-0104.flac	CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT	12.43

2518-154825-0013.flac	JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS	12.925
2518-154825-0014.flac	WHERE THE UNDER CLIFF DIES BACK AGAIN INTO THE CHALK FACE AND CLIMBS BY SLANTS AND ELBOW TURNS UP TO THE TOP THE SHEPHERDS CALL IT THE ZIGZAG AND EVEN SHEEP LOSE THEIR FOOTING ON IT AND OF MEN	14.915
2518-154825-0015.flac	I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE HAD CLIMBED IT AND THAT WAS LANDER JORDAN WHEN THE EXCISE WAS ON HIS HEELS HALF A CENTURY BACK BUT HE THAT TRIES IT STAKES ALL ON HEAD AND FOOT AND A WOUNDED BIRD LIKE THEE MAY NOT DARE THAT FLIGHT	15.35
2518-154825-0016.flac	YET IF THOU ART CONTENT TO HANG THY LIFE UPON A HAIR I WILL CARRY THEE SOME WAY AND WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM TO CARRY	8.29
2518-154825-0017.flac	IT WAS A DESPERATE CHANCE ENOUGH BUT CAME AS WELCOME AS A PATCH OF BLUE THROUGH LOWERING SKIES YES I SAID DEAR MASTER ELZEVIR LET US GET TO IT QUICKLY AND IF WE FALL	13.475
2518-154825-0018.flac	TIS BETTER FAR TO DIE UPON THE ROCKS BELOW THAN TO WAIT HERE FOR THEM TO HALE US OFF TO JAIL AND WITH THAT I TRIED TO STAND THINKING I MIGHT GO DOT AND CARRY EVEN WITH A BROKEN LEG	12.755
2518-154825-0019.flac	AND A THREAD OF BLOOD THAT WELLED UP FROM IT AND TRICKLED OFF ON TO THE SWARD IT WAS A SIGHT TO STAGGER ANY MAN AND WOULD HAVE MADE ME SWOON PERHAPS BUT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WE WERE AT THE END OF THE UNDER CLIFF	15.39
2518-154825-0020.flac	AND TWAS A TASK THAT MIGHT COW THE BRAVEST AND WHEN I LOOKED UPON THE ZIGZAG IT SEEMED BETTER TO STAY WHERE WE WERE AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POSSE THAN SET FOOT ON THAT AWFUL WAY AND FALL UPON THE ROCKS BELOW	13.86
2518-154825-0021.flac	FOR THE ZIGZAG STARTED OFF AS A FAIR ENOUGH CHALK PATH BUT IN A FEW PACES NARROWED DOWN TILL IT WAS BUT A WHITER THREAD AGAINST THE GREY WHITE CLIFF FACE	11.39
2518-154825-0022.flac	FAUGH SAID ELZEVIR TIS A POOR BEAST HAS LOST HIS FOOTHOLD IT WAS AN ILL OMEN ENOUGH AND I SAID AS MUCH BESEECHING HIM TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY UP THE ZIGZAG	13.265
2518-154825-0023.flac	AND LEAVE ME WHERE I WAS FOR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE MERCY ON A BOY TUSH HE CRIED IT IS THY HEART THAT FAILS THEE AND TIS TOO LATE NOW TO CHANGE COUNSEL	13.345
2518-154825-0024.flac	WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES YET TO WIN OR LOSE WITH AND IF WE GAIN THE CLIFF TOP IN THAT TIME WE SHALL HAVE AN HOUR'S START OR MORE FOR THEY WILL TAKE ALL THAT TO SEARCH THE UNDER CLIFF AND MASKEW TOO	14.405
2518-154825-0025.flac	WILL KEEP THEM IN CHECK A LITTLE WHILE THEY TRY TO BRING THE LIFE BACK TO SO GOOD A MAN BUT IF WE FALL WHY WE SHALL FALL TOGETHER AND OUTWIT THEIR CUNNING	11.705
2518-154825-0026.flac	SO SHUT THY EYES AND KEEP THEM TIGHT UNTIL I BID THEE OPEN THEM WITH THAT HE CAUGHT ME UP AGAIN AND I SHUT MY EYES FIRM REBUKING MYSELF FOR MY FAINT HEARTEDNESS AND NOT TELLING HIM HOW MUCH MY FOOT HURT ME	15.78
2518-154825-0027.flac	IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM ELZEVIR'S STEPS THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TURF AND WAS UPON THE CHALK NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MEN BESIDE IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD HAVE VENTURED UP THAT PATH EVEN FREE AND UNTRAMMELLED	14.93
2518-154825-0028.flac	AND NOT A MAN IN ALL THE WORLD TO DO IT WITH A FULL GROWN LAD IN HIS ARMS YET ELZEVIR MADE NO BONES OF IT NOR SPOKE A SINGLE WORD ONLY HE WENT VERY SLOW AND I FELT HIM SCUFFLE WITH HIS FOOT	14.49
2518-154825-0029.flac	THUS HE WENT ON FOR A TIME THAT SEEMED WITHOUT END AND YET WAS REALLY BUT A MINUTE OR TWO AND BY DEGREES I FELT THE WIND THAT WE COULD SCARCE PERCEIVE AT ALL ON THE UNDER CLIFF BLOW FRESHER AND COLD ON THE CLIFF SIDE	15.53
2518-154825-0030.flac	AND THEN THE PATH GREW STEEPER AND STEEPER AND ELZEVIR WENT SLOWER AND SLOWER TILL AT LAST HE SPOKE JOHN I AM GOING TO STOP	12.705
2518-154825-0031.flac	BUT OPEN NOT THY EYES TILL I HAVE SET THEE DOWN AND BID THEE I DID AS BIDDEN AND HE LOWERED ME GENTLY SETTING ME ON ALL FOURS UPON THE PATH AND SPEAKING AGAIN	13.645
2518-154825-0032.flac	THE PATH IS TOO NARROW HERE FOR ME TO CARRY THEE AND THOU MUST CREEP ROUND THIS CORNER ON THY HANDS AND KNEES BUT HAVE A CARE TO KEEP THY OUTER HAND NEAR TO THE INNER AND THE BALANCE OF THY BODY TO THE CLIFF	15.11
2518-154825-0033.flac	FOR THERE IS NO ROOM TO DANCE HORNPIPES HERE AND HOLD THY EYES FIXED ON THE CHALK WALL LOOKING NEITHER DOWN NOR SEAWARD TWAS WELL HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO AND WELL I DID IT	13.635
2518-154825-0034.flac	BUT SPENT MUCH TIME THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS IN TRAVELLING THOSE TEN YARDS TO TAKE ME ROUND THE FIRST ELBOW OF THE PATH FOR MY FOOT WAS HEAVY AND GAVE ME FIERCE PAIN TO DRAG THOUGH I TRIED TO MASK IT FROM ELZEVIR AND HE	14.255
2518-154825-0035.flac	FORGETTING WHAT I SUFFERED CRIED OUT QUICKEN THY PACE LAD IF THOU CANST THE TIME IS SHORT NOW SO FRAIL IS MAN'S TEMPER THAT THOUGH HE WAS DOING MORE THAN ANY EVER DID TO SAVE ANOTHER'S LIFE AND WAS ALL I HAD TO TRUST TO IN THE WORLD YET	15.375
2518-154825-0036.flac	BUT HERE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY FOR THE PATH WAS STILL SO NARROW AND THE CLIFF WALL SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE ME UP IN HIS ARMS SO I LAY FLAT ON MY FACE AND HE STEPPED OVER ME SETTING HIS FOOT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS TO DO IT	14.91
2518-154825-0037.flac	AND THEN WHILE HE KNELT DOWN UPON THE PATH	3.685
2518-154825-0038.flac	PUTTING MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND SO HE BORE ME PICKABACK I SHUT MY EYES FIRM AGAIN AND THUS WE MOVED ALONG ANOTHER SPELL MOUNTING STILL AND FEELING THE WIND STILL FRESHENING	13.66
2518-154825-0039.flac	BOTH WERE ON ALL FOURS NOW ELZEVIR FIRST AND I FOLLOWING BUT AS I CREPT ALONG I RELAXED CARE FOR A MOMENT AND MY EYES WANDERED FROM THE CLIFF SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN AND FAR BELOW	14.995
2518-154825-0040.flac	I SAW THE BLUE SEA TWINKLING LIKE A DAZZLING MIRROR AND THE GULLS WHEELING ABOUT THE SHEER CHALK WALL AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THAT BLOATED CARCASS OF A SHEEP THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THIS VERY SPOT PERHAPS AND IN AN INSTANT	13.85
2518-154825-0041.flac	FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF	16.135
2518-154825-0042.flac	AND HOW HE DID IT IN SUCH A NARROW STRAIT I KNOW NOT BUT HE TURNED ROUND AND LYING DOWN HIMSELF THRUST HIS HAND FIRMLY IN MY BACK PRESSING ME CLOSER TO THE CLIFF YET IT WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR IF HE HAD NOT HELD ME TIGHT	15.29
2518-154825-0043.flac	I SHOULD HAVE FLUNG MYSELF DOWN IN SHEER DESPAIR TO GET QUIT OF THAT DREADFUL SICKNESS KEEP THINE EYES SHUT JOHN HE SAID AND COUNT UP NUMBERS LOUD TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW THOU ART NOT TURNING FAINT	14.445
2518-154825-0044.flac	SO I GAVE OUT ONE TWO THREE AND WHILE I WENT ON COUNTING HEARD HIM REPEATING TO HIMSELF THOUGH HIS WORDS SEEMED THIN AND FAR OFF WE MUST HAVE TAKEN TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE	14.79
2518-154825-0045.flac	AND IN FIVE MORE THEY WILL BE ON THE UNDER CLIFF AND IF WE EVER REACH THE TOP WHO KNOWS BUT THEY HAVE LEFT A GUARD NO NO THEY WILL NOT LEAVE A GUARD FOR NOT A MAN KNOWS OF THE ZIGZAG AND IF THEY KNEW	14.64
2518-154825-0046.flac	LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME	14.555
2518-154825-0047.flac	THUS I LAY WITH MY FACE TO THE CLIFF AND ELZEVIR PUSHING FIRMLY IN MY BACK AND THE THING THAT FRIGHTENED ME MOST WAS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE HAND TO TAKE HOLD OF FOR HAD THERE BEEN A PIECE OF STRING OR EVEN A THREAD OF COTTON	16.09
2518-154825-0048.flac	I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE CLIFF WALL SHEER AND WHITE AGAINST THAT NARROWEST WAY WITH NEVER CRANNY TO PUT A FINGER INTO THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN FRESH PUFFS AND THOUGH I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES	15.925
2518-154825-0049.flac	I KNEW THAT IT WAS MOVING THE LITTLE TUFTS OF BENT GRASS AND THE CHIDING CRIES OF THE GULLS SEEMED TO INVITE ME TO BE DONE WITH FEAR AND PAIN AND BROKEN LEG AND FLING MYSELF OFF ON TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEN ELZEVIR SPOKE JOHN HE SAID	15.675
2518-154825-0050.flac	THERE IS NO TIME TO PLAY THE WOMAN ANOTHER MINUTE OF THIS AND WE ARE LOST PLUCK UP THY COURAGE KEEP THY EYES TO THE CLIFF AND FORWARD YET I COULD NOT BUT ANSWERED I CANNOT I CANNOT	14.28
2518-154825-0051.flac	MOVE THOU MUST AND TIS BETTER TO RISK FALLING NOW THAN FALL FOR CERTAIN WITH ANOTHER BULLET IN THEE LATER ON AND WITH THAT HE SHIFTED HIS HAND FROM MY BACK AND FIXED IT IN MY COAT COLLAR MOVING BACKWARDS HIMSELF AND SETTING TO DRAG ME AFTER HIM	16.34
2518-154825-0052.flac	NOW I WAS SO BESOTTED WITH FRIGHT THAT I WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH FEARING TO FALL OVER IF I OPENED MY EYES AND ELZEVIR FOR ALL HE WAS SO STRONG COULD NOT PULL A HELPLESS LUMP BACKWARDS UP THAT PATH	13.525
2518-154825-0053.flac	SO HE GAVE IT UP LEAVING GO HOLD ON ME WITH A GROAN AND AT THAT MOMENT THERE ROSE FROM THE UNDER CLIFF BELOW A SOUND OF VOICES AND SHOUTING ZOUNDS THEY ARE DOWN ALREADY CRIED ELZEVIR AND HAVE FOUND MASKEW'S BODY	14.645
2518-154825-0054.flac	IT IS ALL UP ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEY WILL SEE US BUT SO STRANGE IS THE FORCE OF MIND ON BODY AND THE POWER OF A GREATER TO MASTER A LESSER FEAR THAT WHEN I HEARD THOSE VOICES FROM BELOW ALL FRIGHT OF FALLING LEFT ME IN A MOMENT	15.475
2518-154825-0055.flac	AND I COULD OPEN MY EYES WITHOUT A TRACE OF GIDDINESS SO I BEGAN TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ELZEVIR	9.435
2518-154825-0056.flac	THINKING THAT WE WERE HIDING BY THE SEA FIVE MINUTES LATER ELZEVIR STEPPED ON TO THE CLIFF TOP WITH ME UPON HIS BACK WE HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF THIS THROW HE SAID AND ARE SAFE FOR ANOTHER HOUR THOUGH I THOUGHT THY GIDDY HEAD HAD RUINED US	15.79
2518-154826-0000.flac	THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS	13.025
2518-154826-0001.flac	WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN	15.14
2518-154826-0002.flac	AND THE WIND WHICH A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THREATENED TO BLOW ME FROM THAT NARROW LEDGE SEEMED NOW BUT THE GENTLEST OF BREEZES FRESH WITH THE BREATH OF THE KINDLY SEA BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ANGUISH CAME BACK AND GREW APACE	14.565
2518-154826-0003.flac	AND I FELL TO THINKING DISMALLY OF THE PLIGHT WE WERE IN HOW THINGS HAD BEEN AGAINST US IN THESE LAST DAYS FIRST THERE WAS LOSING THE WHY NOT AND THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH SECOND	12.405
2518-154826-0004.flac	THERE WAS THE BEING KNOWN BY THE EXCISE FOR SMUGGLERS AND PERHAPS FOR MURDERERS THIRD AND LAST THERE WAS THE BREAKING OF MY LEG WHICH MADE ESCAPE SO DIFFICULT BUT MOST OF ALL	12.45
2518-154826-0005.flac	THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP	15.685
2518-154826-0006.flac	AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY	12.49
2518-154826-0007.flac	THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE	15.975
2518-154826-0008.flac	AND SO HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND STARTED OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS I NEED NOT TELL OF THAT WEARY JOURNEY AND INDEED COULD NOT IF I WISHED FOR THE PAIN WENT TO MY HEAD AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH A DROWSY ANGUISH	13.905
2518-154826-0009.flac	THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER	10.665
2518-154826-0010.flac	IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS	13.275
2518-154826-0011.flac	THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR	15.845
2518-154826-0012.flac	BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT	14.475
2518-154826-0013.flac	THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON	15.085
2518-154826-0014.flac	AND IF THEY COME I CANNOT HELP IT FOR WEARINESS AND THE SUN'S HEAT HAVE MADE MY FEET LIKE LEAD A SCORE OF YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SUCH A TASK BUT NOW TIS DIFFERENT	11.09
2518-154826-0015.flac	SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP	12.46
2518-154826-0016.flac	I WISH I HAD A THIMBLEFUL OF POWDER TO MAKE THIS WHISTLE SOUND' AND HE TOOK MASKEW'S SILVER BUTTED PISTOL AGAIN FROM HIS BOSOM AND HANDLED IT LOVINGLY	9.01
2518-154826-0017.flac	WITH THAT HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN WHERE THERE WAS A NARROW SHADOW CLOSE AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL AND IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM HIS HEAVY BREATHING THAT HE WAS ASLEEP THE WIND HAD FRESHENED MUCH AND WAS BLOWING STRONG FROM THE WEST	15.51
2518-154826-0018.flac	AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL	2.785
2518-154826-0019.flac	AND GETS AT LENGTH INTO SHELTER MOREOVER THOUGH I WAS NOT TIRED BY GRIEVOUS TOIL LIKE ELZEVIR I HAD PASSED A NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP AND FELT BESIDES THE WEARINESS OF PAIN TO LULL ME TO SLUMBER	12.855
2518-154826-0020.flac	THEN I SOUGHT SOMETHING TO FIX MY THOUGHTS AND LOOKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL WHERE THE SWARD WAS FELL TO COUNTING THE MOLE HILLS THAT WERE CAST UP IN NUMBERS THEREABOUT AND WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THEM AND RECKONED UP THIRTY LITTLE HEAPS OF DRY AND POWDERY BROWN EARTH	14.985
2518-154826-0021.flac	THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY	15.74
2518-154826-0022.flac	BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG	13.3
2518-154826-0023.flac	AND THOUGH I COULD SEE NOTHING I KNEW THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED VERY NEAR US I WAS FOR WAKING ELZEVIR BUT HE WAS ALREADY FULL AWAKE AND PUT A FINGER ON HIS LIP TO SHOW I SHOULD NOT SPEAK THEN	11.935
2518-154826-0024.flac	ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH THE LEAVES WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF AND SAID TIS BUT A LAD SCARING ROOKS WITH A BLUNDERBUSS WE WILL NOT STIR UNLESS HE MAKES THIS WAY A MINUTE LATER HE SAID THE BOY IS COMING STRAIGHT FOR THE WALL	15.865
2518-154826-0025.flac	WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF	14.515
2518-154826-0026.flac	BUT ELZEVIR PASSED HIM THE TIME OF DAY IN A CIVIL VOICE AND HE STOPPED AND GAVE IT BACK WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SON BLOCK ASKED SCARING ROOKS FOR FARMER TOPP WAS THE ANSWER	12.25
2518-154826-0027.flac	HAVE YOU GOT A CHARGE OF POWDER TO SPARE SAID ELZEVIR SHOWING HIS PISTOL I WANT TO GET A RABBIT IN THE GORSE FOR SUPPER AND HAVE DROPPED MY FLASK MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN A FLASK IN WALKING THROUGH THE FURROWS HE WHISPERED TO ME TO LIE STILL	14.89
2518-154826-0028.flac	NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY	13.795
2518-154826-0029.flac	AND HIS VOICE HAD SOMETHING OF SURPRISE IN IT NAY BUT MY SHOT ARE OVER SMALL	5.785
2518-154826-0030.flac	BUT THOU MUST PAY A SHILLING FOR THEM MY MASTER SAYS I NEVER AM TO USE THEM EXCEPT I SEE A SWAN OR BUZZARD OR SOMETHING FIT TO COOK COME OVER I SHALL GET A SOUND BEATING FOR MY PAINS AND TO BE BEAT IS WORTH A SHILLING IF THOU ART BEAT BE BEAT FOR SOMETHING MORE SAYS ELZEVIR THE TEMPTER	16.725
2518-154826-0031.flac	THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION	16.35
2518-154826-0032.flac	FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK	14.765
2518-154826-0033.flac	THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB	14.66
2518-154826-0034.flac	AND SO I SAID AS MUCH TO ELZEVIR WHO ONLY LAUGHED SAYING THE BOY WAS SIMPLE AND HARMLESS BUT FROM WHERE I SAT I COULD PEEP OUT THROUGH THE BRAMBLES IN THE OPEN GAP AND SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THERE WAS MY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WALKING CARELESSLY ENOUGH	14.11
2518-154826-0035.flac	BUT WHEN ELZEVIR SAT DOWN THE BOY GAVE A CAREFUL LOOK ROUND AND SEEING NO ONE WATCHING ANY MORE	5.68
2518-154826-0036.flac	THEN I KNEW THAT HE HAD GUESSED WHO WE WERE AND WAS OFF TO WARN THE HUE AND CRY BUT BEFORE ELZEVIR WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN THE BOY WAS OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HILL BROW LET US MOVE ON SAID BLOCK TIS BUT A LITTLE DISTANCE NOW TO GO AND THE HEAT IS PAST ALREADY	15.83
2518-154826-0037.flac	WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE	16.235
2518-154826-0038.flac	AND IN THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS WE HAD SLEPT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT FOR THE SUN WAS WESTERING FAST AND THOUGH THE REST HAD REFRESHED ME MY LEG HAD GROWN STIFF AND HURT THE MORE IN DANGLING WHEN WE STARTED AGAIN	12.515
2518-154826-0039.flac	ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT	12.87
2518-154826-0040.flac	ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY	13.43
2518-154826-0041.flac	AND I AM TOLD IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL AND THE WAY OF MAKING A MARBLE QUARRY IS TO SINK A TUNNEL SLANTING VERY STEEPLY DOWN INTO THE EARTH LIKE A WELL TURNED ASKEW TILL YOU REACH FIFTY SEVENTY OR PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP THEN	15.34
2518-154826-0042.flac	FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES	14.505
2518-154826-0043.flac	WHICH WAS JUST PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTER GREEN OF SPRING THIS TURF WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HUMMOCKY FOR UNDER IT LAY HEAPS OF WORTHLESS STONE AND MARBLE DRAWN OUT OF THE QUARRIES AGES AGO WHICH THE GREEN VESTMENT HAD COVERED FOR THE MOST PART	13.535
2518-154826-0044.flac	THOUGH IT LEFT SOMETIMES A LITTLE PATCH OF BROKEN RUBBLE PEERING OUT AT THE TOP OF A MOUND THERE WERE MANY TUMBLE DOWN WALLS AND LOW GABLES LEFT OF THE COTTAGES OF THE OLD QUARRYMEN GRASS COVERED RIDGES MARKED OUT THE LITTLE GARDEN FOLDS	14.145
2518-154826-0045.flac	AND HERE AND THERE STILL STOOD A FORLORN GOOSEBERRY BUSH	3.425
2518-154826-0046.flac	ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS	10.785
2518-154826-0047.flac	FOR IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS HOLY PURPOSE THE MANDRIVE WOULD HAVE POWER TO STRANGLE THE MAN THAT HEWED IT IT WAS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE OLD SHAFTS THAT ELZEVIR LAID ME DOWN AT LAST THE LIGHT WAS VERY LOW	11.8
2518-154826-0048.flac	AND THE SWARD CREPT OVER THE EDGES OF THE HOLE AND EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE IN STEPS AND SLIDE WAS GREEN WITH FERNS THE GREEN FERNS SHROUDED THE WALLS OF THE HOLE AND RUDDY BROWN BRAMBLES OVERGREW THE STEPS	12.61
2518-154826-0049.flac	THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY	10.64
2518-154826-0050.flac	AND BEFORE THEY COME TO WHERE WE LIE WE CAN HOLD THE TROOP AT BAY AND SELL OUR LIVES SO DEAR THEY WILL NOT CARE TO BUY THEM WE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STEPS BACK FIRST AS ONE GOES DOWN A HATCHWAY	15.36
2518-154826-0051.flac	AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN	16.015
2518-154826-0052.flac	HE SHOVED THEM ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND SCREENED MY DANGLING LEG FROM GETTING CAUGHT THUS HE CAME SAFE WITHOUT STUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WAS DARK BUT HE STEPPED OFF INTO A NARROW OPENING ON THE RIGHT HAND	15.175
2518-154826-0053.flac	AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN	15.88
2518-154826-0054.flac	AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH	8.695

3259-158083-0101.flac	INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED	14.6
3259-158083-0102.flac	AND THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT THE MATRON AND GUARDS WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ACT TOWARDS US AS THEY HAD ACTED UNLESS THEY RELIED UPON THE SUPPORT OF HIGHER AUTHORITIES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE FROM THE TIME WE REACHED THE WORKHOUSE TO TERRORIZE US AND MY FEAR	15.875

3259-158083-0108.flac	AND THIS WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE SEWING ROOM THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON OUR NERVES CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED EVERY CONCEIVABLE LIE WAS TRIED IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE WOMEN TO ABANDON THEIR VARIOUS FORM OF RESISTANCE	13.915

3259-158083-0119.flac	THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID OPENING UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA PERSONS CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT LAW WERE TRANSPORTED TO VIRGINIA ALIEN TERRITORY TO SERVE THEIR TERMS	16.51
3259-158083-0120.flac	IT WAS A MOOT POINT WHETHER PRISONERS WERE SO TREATED WITH SUFFICIENT WARRANT IN LAW EMINENT JURISTS HELD THAT THE DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO CONVICT A PERSON UNDER ITS LAWS AND COMMIT THAT PERSON TO CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER STATE THEY CONTENDED THAT SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON A PERSON FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE DISTRICT	16.34

3259-158083-0123.flac	THE WOMEN SUSPECTED HIS SOLICITUDE AND REFUSED TO MAKE ANY PROMISE WHATSOEVER WITHOUT FIRST BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THEIR OWN ATTORNEY WE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SERVE THE WRIT ORDINARILY THIS WOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO BUT FOR US IT DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DIFFICULT TASK	14.835
3259-158083-0124.flac	A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE	10.52

3526-175658-0024.flac	SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE	15.8
3526-175658-0025.flac	AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF	11.065

4406-16883-0013.flac	AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAP FOR HIS BOY FOR WHICH HE INVITED ME TO DINNER I WENT AND HE GAVE ME A PANCAKE ABOUT AS BIG AS TWO FINGERS IT WAS MADE OF PARCHED WHEAT BEATEN AND FRIED IN BEAR'S GREASE	13.395
4406-16883-0014.flac	AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE	13.825
4406-16883-0015.flac	HEARING THAT MY SON WAS COME TO THIS PLACE I WENT TO SEE HIM AND FOUND HIM LYING FLAT UPON THE GROUND I ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD SLEEP SO HE ANSWERED ME THAT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT AT PRAYER AND LAY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE WAS DOING	15.095
4406-16883-0016.flac	I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND	13.925
4406-16883-0017.flac	WHO OWNED THAT MARY THURSTON CAME RUNNING AFTER ME AND GOT IT AWAY AGAIN	4.95
4406-16883-0018.flac	I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY	12.915
4406-16883-0019.flac	AND SELL ME FOR POWDER FOR SO THEY HAD SOMETIMES DISCOURSED I WAS UTTERLY HOPELESS OF GETTING HOME ON FOOT THE WAY THAT I CAME I COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF THE MANY WEARY STEPS I HAD TAKEN TO COME TO THIS PLACE THE NINTH REMOVE	15.245
4406-16883-0020.flac	BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING	14.385
4406-16883-0021.flac	BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT	16.87
4406-16883-0022.flac	AND I WAS NOT A LITTLE GLAD THAT I HAD ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT OF AND BE PLEASED WITH WHEN WE WERE AT THIS PLACE MY MASTER'S MAID CAME HOME SHE HAD BEEN GONE THREE WEEKS INTO THE NARRAGANSETT COUNTRY TO FETCH CORN	14.825
4406-16883-0023.flac	WHERE THEY HAD STORED UP SOME IN THE GROUND	2.63
4406-16883-0024.flac	I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US	14.245
4406-16883-0025.flac	AND THEN I RETURNED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNED I FOUND MYSELF AS UNSATISFIED AS I WAS BEFORE	6.005
4406-16883-0026.flac	MY SON WAS ILL AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF HIS MOURNFUL LOOKS AND NO CHRISTIAN FRIEND WAS NEAR HIM TO DO ANY OFFICE OF LOVE FOR HIM EITHER FOR SOUL OR BODY AND MY POOR GIRL I KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR WELL OR ALIVE OR DEAD	16.955
4406-16883-0027.flac	I REPAIRED UNDER THESE THOUGHTS TO MY BIBLE MY GREAT COMFORT IN THAT TIME AND THAT SCRIPTURE CAME TO MY HAND CAST THY BURDEN UPON THE LORD AND HE SHALL SUSTAIN THEE PSALM FIFTY FIVE	13.26
4406-16883-0028.flac	FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET	6.295
4406-16883-0029.flac	BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE	10.57
4406-16883-0030.flac	AND GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS AND BADE ME COME AGAIN AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD BUY ME IF THEY WERE ABLE AND YET THESE WERE STRANGERS TO ME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE THE TENTH REMOVE	11.4
4406-16883-0031.flac	AND PUT IT INTO MY POCKET AND NEVER LET HER SEE IT AFTERWARD THEN THEY PACKED UP THEIR THINGS TO BE GONE AND GAVE ME MY LOAD I COMPLAINED IT WAS TOO HEAVY WHEREUPON SHE GAVE ME A SLAP IN THE FACE AND BADE ME GO	12.275
4406-16883-0032.flac	I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE	13.39
4406-16883-0033.flac	MUCH CHEERED MY SPIRIT AND MADE MY BURDEN SEEM LIGHT AND ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT AND GREAT PERPLEXITY THE SCALE WAS SOON TURNED FOR WHEN WE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY ON A SUDDEN MY MISTRESS GIVES OUT	15.35
4406-16883-0034.flac	AND WOULD HAVE HAD HIM GONE BACK ALSO BUT HE WOULD NOT BUT SAID HE WOULD GO ON AND COME TO US AGAIN IN THREE DAYS MY SPIRIT WAS UPON THIS I CONFESS VERY IMPATIENT AND ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS	14.705
4406-16883-0035.flac	BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX	5.045
4406-16883-0036.flac	WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN	15.765
4406-16883-0037.flac	I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT TELL WHERE TO GO THEY BADE ME GO LOOK I TOLD THEM IF I WENT TO ANOTHER WIGWAM THEY WOULD BE ANGRY AND SEND ME HOME AGAIN THEN ONE OF THE COMPANY DREW HIS SWORD AND TOLD ME HE WOULD RUN ME THROUGH IF I DID NOT GO PRESENTLY THEN	16.005
4406-16883-0038.flac	WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT	15.46
4406-16883-0039.flac	I WENT TO ONE WIGWAM AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO ROOM THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER AND THEY SAID THE SAME AT LAST AN OLD INDIAN BADE ME TO COME TO HIM AND HIS SQUAW GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS	12.615
4406-16883-0040.flac	AND A GOOD FIRE WE HAD AND THROUGH THE GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD I HAD A COMFORTABLE LODGING THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING ANOTHER INDIAN BADE ME COME AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD GIVE ME SIX GROUND NUTS WHICH I DID	14.085
4406-16883-0041.flac	WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK	15.68
4406-16883-0042.flac	BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED	12.7
4406-16883-0043.flac	WHERE WE ABODE ALMOST A FORTNIGHT HERE ONE ASKED ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HER PAPOOSE FOR WHICH SHE GAVE ME A MESS OF BROTH WHICH WAS THICKENED WITH MEAL MADE OF THE BARK OF A TREE AND TO MAKE IT THE BETTER	13.275
4406-16883-0044.flac	AND A FEW ROASTED GROUND NUTS I HAD NOT SEEN MY SON A PRETTY WHILE	5.03
4406-16883-0045.flac	AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM	7.24
4406-16883-0046.flac	AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT	7.405
4406-16883-0047.flac	THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME	9.7
4406-16883-0048.flac	YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB	4.925
4406-16883-0049.flac	BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES	14.72
4406-16883-0050.flac	BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED	15.15
4406-16883-0051.flac	I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND	8.225
4406-16883-0052.flac	AS MY MASTER SPAKE BUT INSTEAD OF THAT MY MASTER HIMSELF WAS GONE AND I LEFT BEHIND SO THAT MY SPIRIT WAS NOW QUITE READY TO SINK I ASKED THEM TO LET ME GO OUT AND PICK UP SOME STICKS THAT I MIGHT GET ALONE AND POUR OUT MY HEART UNTO THE LORD	15.125
4406-16883-0053.flac	THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT	15.905
4406-16883-0054.flac	HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE	14.15
4406-16883-0055.flac	THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE	14.995
4406-16883-0056.flac	AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS	13.76
4406-16883-0057.flac	I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP	4.56
4406-16883-0058.flac	WERE GOING TO THE FRENCH FOR POWDER BUT BY THE WAY THE MOHAWKS MET WITH THEM AND KILLED FOUR OF THEIR COMPANY WHICH MADE THE REST TURN BACK AGAIN FOR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN SOLD TO THE FRENCH	14.29
4406-16883-0059.flac	THAN IT PROVED TO BE IN HIS REMAINING WITH THE INDIANS I WENT TO SEE AN ENGLISH YOUTH IN THIS PLACE	6.555
4406-16883-0060.flac	HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED	11.19
5778-12761-0011.flac	ON THE SHORE OF THE BAY EIGHTY MILES DISTANT AXES AND MAULS WERE NECESSARY TODAY TO MAKE A ROAD THROUGH THE SNOW GOING AHEAD WITH CARSON TO RECONNOITRE THE ROAD WE REACHED IN THE AFTERNOON THE RIVER WHICH MADE THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE	15.51
5778-12761-0012.flac	CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER	12.405
5778-12761-0013.flac	IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL	15.285
5778-12761-0014.flac	BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK	14.525

5778-12761-0020.flac	UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE	9.74
5778-12761-0021.flac	CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM	10.395
5778-12761-0022.flac	THEY WERE FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND TWO IN DIAMETER WITH A UNIFORM TUFTED TOP AND THE SUMMER GREEN OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE WITH THE SINGING BIRDS AND THE SWEET SUMMER WIND WHICH WAS WHIRLING ABOUT THE DRY OAK LEAVES	13.85
5778-12761-0023.flac	NEARLY INTOXICATED US WITH DELIGHT AND WE HURRIED ON FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT TO ESCAPE ENTIRELY FROM THE HORRID REGION OF INHOSPITABLE SNOW TO THE PERPETUAL SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO	13.77

5778-12761-0033.flac	HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED	14.715
5778-12761-0034.flac	IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING	15.125
5778-12761-0035.flac	WHEN HORSES DIED AND WHEN MULES AND HORSES READY TO DIE OF STARVATION WERE KILLED FOR FOOD YET THERE WAS NO MURMURING OR HESITATION IN THE MEANTIME MISTER PREUSS CONTINUED ON DOWN THE RIVER	13.2049375

5778-12761-0037.flac	WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER	13.795
5778-12761-0038.flac	AND WE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD PUSHED ON DOWN THE STREAM I DETERMINED TO KEEP OUT FROM THE RIVER ALONG WHICH IT WAS NEARLY IMPRACTICABLE TO TRAVEL WITH ANIMALS UNTIL IT SHOULD FORM A VALLEY	11.42
5778-12761-0039.flac	AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK	11.435
5778-12761-0040.flac	AND WITH THESE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY A NEW SPECIES OF OAK BEARING A LONG SLENDER ACORN FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH WHICH WE NOW BEGAN TO SEE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL VEGETABLE FOOD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS REGION	14.24
5778-12761-0041.flac	IN A SHORT DISTANCE WE CROSSED A LITTLE RIVULET WHERE WERE TWO OLD HUTS AND NEAR BY WERE HEAPS OF ACORN HULLS THE GROUND ROUND ABOUT WAS VERY RICH COVERED WITH AN EXUBERANT SWARD OF GRASS	12.685
5778-12761-0042.flac	AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER	14.89
5778-12761-0043.flac	BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS	11.68
5778-12761-0044.flac	WHO MISTAKING US FOR HIS FELLOWS HAD BEEN ONLY UNDECEIVED BY GETTING CLOSE UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO WITNESS HIS ASTONISHMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED HAD SOME OF THE OLD MOUNTAIN SPIRITS THEY ARE SO MUCH AFRAID OF	14.455
5778-12761-0045.flac	SUDDENLY APPEARED IN HIS PATH IGNORANT OF THE CHARACTER OF THESE PEOPLE WE HAD NOW ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF UNEASINESS IN REGARD TO MISTER PREUSS HE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM AND WE BEGAN TO THINK HIS CHANCE DOUBTFUL	14.24
5778-12761-0046.flac	AT ONE OF THESE ORCHARD GROUNDS WE ENCAMPED ABOUT NOON TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR MISTER PREUSS ONE MAN TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A SPUR LEADING INTO THE RIVER IN HOPE TO CROSS HIS TRAIL AND ANOTHER TOOK OUR OWN BACK	13.44
5778-12761-0047.flac	BOTH WERE VOLUNTEERS AND TO THE SUCCESSFUL MAN WAS PROMISED A PAIR OF PISTOLS NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE WHICH WOULD FREE US ALL FROM MUCH ANXIETY	12.545
5778-12761-0048.flac	AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION	11.135
5778-12761-0049.flac	SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT	5.715
5778-54535-0000.flac	HE MEANT TO HAVE IT ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO HE CALLED AN OFFICER INTO HIS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SAID NOW TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE ALL THE MEN YOU WANT TO HELP YOU	13.14
5778-54535-0001.flac	BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID	16.705

5778-54535-0004.flac	THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY	13.835
5778-54535-0005.flac	BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT	13.915
5778-54535-0006.flac	SHE USED TO SAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS COME BOYS EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND GATHER UP YOUR TOYS WE WILL PUT THE KNIVES AND MARBLES AWAY AND GET READY FOR SUNDAY ALL DAY SUNDAY THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO READ ANY BOOK BUT THE BIBLE	15.69
5778-54535-0007.flac	BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE	15.85
5778-54535-0008.flac	ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP	13.805
5778-54535-0009.flac	JIMMIE HAD DELICATE FEATURES AND LONG SILKY BROWN CURLS THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE IN AMONG THESE WAS ONE WHITE LOCK THAT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD THIS LOOKED LIKE A TINY FEATHER	13.775
5778-54535-0010.flac	MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT	10.18
5778-54535-0011.flac	THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA	14.015
5778-54535-0012.flac	IT WAS A LONG HARD VOYAGE THERE AND POOR LITTLE CHARLIE DIED ON THE WAY THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE BETTER SAILORS AND WERE AS WELL AS COULD BE WHEN THEY MET THEIR FATHER THEY DID ENJOY THE STRANGE SIGHTS IN SAINT PETERSBURG	14.46
5778-54535-0013.flac	THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY	15.075
5778-54535-0014.flac	STILL THEIR PARENTS DID NOT LET THEM FORGET THEY WERE LITTLE AMERICANS THE CLIMATE DID NOT AGREE WITH JAMES AND EVERY TIME HE CAUGHT COLD HE HAD TOUCHES OF RHEUMATISM SO THAT OFTEN HE HAD TO STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE HIS FEET PUT IN HOT WATER	15.49
5778-54535-0015.flac	INSTEAD OF MAKING A FUSS ABOUT THIS HE USED TO CALL FOR PENCIL AND PAPER AND PRACTISE DRAWING FEET UNTIL HE COULD MAKE VERY PERFECT ONES MAJOR WHISTLER SENT HIM TO THE ART ACADEMY IN SAINT PETERSBURG WHERE HE WAS PRAISED BY HIS TEACHERS	15.8199375
5778-54535-0016.flac	THAT OLD TIRESOME RHEUMATISM KEPT BOTHERING HIM AND BY AND BY HE HAD A LONG RHEUMATIC FEVER	6.9350625
5778-54535-0017.flac	HE WAS A DEAR PATIENT BOY HOWEVER AND AFTERWARDS DECLARED HE WAS ALMOST GLAD HE HAD IT BECAUSE SOME ONE WHO PITIED THE SMALL INVALID SENT HIM A BOOK OF HOGARTH'S ENGRAVINGS	11.755
5778-54535-0018.flac	I WANT YOU TO BE SURE AND REMEMBER ABOUT THIS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN ACCUSED HIM OF BEING CROSS AND RUDE BUT AT THIS TIME I AM SURE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN NICER	13.6
5778-54535-0019.flac	JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING	11.405
5778-54535-0020.flac	THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM	13.705
5778-54535-0021.flac	HE ALWAYS WAS AS POLITE TO HER AS IF SHE WERE THE EMPEROR'S WIFE THE MAJOR WORKED TOO HARD ON THE GREAT RAILWAY AND DIED BEFORE JAMES WAS FIFTEEN	10.44
5778-54535-0022.flac	THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND	13.04
5778-54535-0023.flac	SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY TO SPEND BUT THOUGHT JAMES SHOULD GO TO WEST POINT TO GET THE MILITARY TRAINING HIS FATHER HAD HAD AT THIS ACADEMY HE FOUND HE DID NOT LIKE TO DRAW MAPS AND FORTS NEARLY AS WELL AS HE DID HUMAN FIGURES AND FACES	15.28
5778-54535-0024.flac	ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON TO DRAW MAPS FOR THE COAST SURVEY HE FORGOT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND FILLED UP THE NICE WHITE MARGINS WITH PERT LITTLE DANCING FOLKS HE WAS WELL SCOLDED FOR THIS I CAN TELL YOU	14.37
5778-54535-0025.flac	JAMES WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AT THIS TIME AND LIKED TO GO ABOUT TO DANCING PARTIES IN THE EVENING HE EARNED VERY LITTLE MAKING MAPS AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE REAL NARROW TAILED COAT WHICH WAS PROPER	13.19
5778-54535-0026.flac	SO HE USED TO TAKE HIS FROCK COAT THAT HE WORE ALL DAY AND PIN IT BACK TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS COAT AND START OFF FOR BIG BALLS WHERE NOBODY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DROLL THINGS AND WAS SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS WELCOME IN ANY DRESS	16.28
5778-54535-0027.flac	AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST	13.43
5778-54535-0028.flac	HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON	11.065
5778-54535-0029.flac	IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES	14.305
5778-54535-0030.flac	THE ROOM LOOKED SO BARE AND HOMELY THAT WHISTLER PAINTED A VERY GOOD IMITATION OF FURNITURE ROUND THE WALLS OF HIS ROOM SO GOOD IN FACT THAT A RICH MAN WHO CAME TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE IMITATION CHAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR	15.94
5778-54535-0031.flac	IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID	12.625
5778-54535-0032.flac	JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED	8.52
5778-54535-0033.flac	HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AT LAST AND JUST AS LIFE SEEMED BRIGHT AN ART CRITIC MISTER JOHN RUSKIN DECLARED THAT THE WHISTLER PICTURES WHICH WERE BEING BOUGHT AT BIG PRICES WERE POOR VERY POOR	14.055
5778-54535-0034.flac	MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE	14.15
5778-54535-0035.flac	WELL IT DID NOT LOOK FOR A WHILE AS IF THERE WAS ANY MORE GOOD LUCK IN THE WORLD FOR JAMES WHISTLER HE DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME IN GETTING A LAWYER TO SUE MISTER RUSKIN FOR SPOILING THE SALE OF HIS PICTURES	12.405
5778-54535-0036.flac	THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC	15.2
5778-54535-0037.flac	BUT EVEN MORE MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO HEAR THE SHARP QUESTIONS OF THE LAWYERS AND THE CLEVER ANSWERS OF RUSKIN AND WHISTLER WHISTLER WON THE CASE WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ONE FARTHING FOR DAMAGES THIS IS ONLY A QUARTER OF A CENT IN OUR MONEY	15.655
5778-54535-0038.flac	WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM	15.13
5778-54535-0039.flac	ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS WORTH NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE HEARD THE TALK THAT WENT ON IN THE COURT ROOM LATER MISTER WHISTLER RECEIVED MUCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR A SINGLE PICTURE	11.74
5778-54535-0040.flac	TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE	13.69
5778-54535-0041.flac	AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS	12.52
5778-54535-0042.flac	THE SCOTCH PEOPLE WANTED TO OWN THE PORTRAIT OF CARLYLE AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW WAS GLAD TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT MISTER WHISTLER MARRIED A WOMAN WHO WAS HERSELF AN ARTIST AND SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM	13.535
5778-54535-0043.flac	THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND	13.61
5778-54535-0044.flac	JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES	14.88
5778-54535-0045.flac	AND FRANCE GERMANY AND ITALY MADE HIM AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR A COMMANDER AND A CHEVALIER	7.545
5778-54535-0046.flac	HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK	11.56
5778-54535-0047.flac	YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED	14.67
5778-54535-0048.flac	HE TRAVELED A GREAT DEAL PAINTING VIEWS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND STUDYING THE PICTURES OF OTHER ARTISTS BUT HOGARTH WAS HIS FAVORITE AND IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER LIES BURIED VERY NEAR HOGARTH IN LONDON	14.73
6415-100596-0012.flac	SHE HASN'T PAID HER DUES AND AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT	4.545

831-130746-0055.flac	ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON	10.84
831-130746-0056.flac	AND IT WAS CHIEFLY BY GOOD LUCK AND THE FACT THAT MOST ROADS ABOUT A TOWN CONVERGE THEREUPON THAT CHICHESTER WAS AT LAST ATTAINED IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS THOUGH EVERYONE HAD GONE TO BED BUT THE RED HOTEL STILL GLOWED YELLOW AND WARM	14.765
831-130746-0057.flac	BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOOD TO DARE ANYTHING SO YOU FOUND YOUR YOUNG LADY AT LAST SAID THE OSTLER OF THE RED HOTEL	7.93
831-130746-0058.flac	QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING SAID HOOPDRIVER WITH SPLENDID READINESS MY SISTER HAD GONE TO BOGNOR BUT I BROUGHT HER BACK HERE I'VE TOOK A FANCY TO THIS PLACE AND THE MOONLIGHT'S SIMPLY DEE VINE WE'VE HAD SUPPER THENKS AND WE'RE TIRED SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER	15.23
831-130746-0059.flac	I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS	15.65
831-130746-0060.flac	BUT THIS WAS LIVING INDEED HE TOLD HIMSELF	3.075
911-128684-0011.flac	IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM	12.26
911-128684-0012.flac	TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION	11.775
911-128684-0013.flac	THE MUTUAL IMPENETRABILITY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE AND INTERACTION ON THE OTHER THAT WHAT IN ITSELF IS ONE AND THE SAME ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THUS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS	15.015
911-128684-0014.flac	IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING	12.76
911-128684-0015.flac	BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES	15.455
911-128684-0016.flac	IT IS ABSOLUTELY INERT IT IS THUS BOTH ENERGETIC AND INERT AND THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU VARY THE ASSOCIATES PROPERLY OF EVERY OTHER PIECE OF EXPERIENCE	12.315
911-128684-0017.flac	IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT	12.64
911-128684-0018.flac	IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS	11.5
911-128684-0019.flac	IN SUCH A WORLD THE MENTAL OR THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF ANY PIECE OF EXPERIENCE WOULD BE UNEQUIVOCAL WHEN ACTIVE IT WOULD FIGURE IN THE PHYSICAL AND WHEN INACTIVE IN THE MENTAL GROUP	13.54
911-128684-0020.flac	BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS	13.35
911-128684-0021.flac	IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO	14.18
911-128684-0022.flac	THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION	13.81
911-128684-0023.flac	CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS	9.815
911-128684-0024.flac	IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT	13.105
911-128684-0025.flac	SO WE FIND IT EASY TO LET THEM FLOAT AMBIGUOUSLY SOMETIMES CLASSING THEM WITH OUR FEELINGS SOMETIMES WITH MORE PHYSICAL REALITIES ACCORDING TO CAPRICE OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF THE MOMENT	13.425
911-128684-0026.flac	THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY	14.85
911-128684-0027.flac	WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND	8.83

911-128684-0029.flac	AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM	13.08
911-128684-0030.flac	OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS	10.055
911-128684-0031.flac	OR IS IT A FEELING IN OUR MIND PRACTICALLY WE TREAT IT AS BOTH OR AS EITHER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPORARY DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHT BEAUTY SAYS PROFESSOR SANTAYANA IS PLEASURE OBJECTIFIED	15.36

911-128684-0033.flac	MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES	15.005
911-128684-0034.flac	WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY	15.105

911-128684-0062.flac	TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER	13.91

911-128684-0064.flac	NOR DOES ITS USE OR SIGNIFICANCE	2.925
911-128684-0065.flac	ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID	10.665

911-128684-0084.flac	IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS	14.015
911-128684-0085.flac	AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE	15.095

911-130578-0009.flac	BUT THIS ONLY BROKE HER TEETH AND MADE HER MOUTH BLEED SO THAT THE PAIN WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THEN THE BOY JEERED AT HER AND SAID DID YOU THINK GRANNIE THAT YOU COULD BITE MY IRON BOW AND ARROWS SO SAYING HE LEFT HER	15.815

4959-28865-0011.flac	I DID HEAR THAT THE HORSE IN WHICH YOU ARE BOTH INTERESTED HAD FAILED TO WIN THE RACE YES HE DID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CALL HIM YOUR GRACE	10.485
4959-28865-0012.flac	OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO A CERTAIN MINISTRY WHICH I WISH IT WAS GOING ON TO DAY INSTEAD OF THE SEEDY LOT WE'VE GOT IN I THINK MY LORD DUKE THAT ANY ONE YOU MAY ASK WILL TELL YOU THAT I KNOW WHAT RUNNING IS WELL I CAN ASSURE YOU	15.405
4959-28865-0013.flac	YOUR GRACE THAT IS THAT SINCE I'VE SEEN ORSES I'VE NEVER SEEN A ORSE FITTER THAN HIM WHEN HE GOT HIS CANTER THAT MORNING IT WAS NEARLY EVEN BETTING NOT THAT I OR SILVERBRIDGE WERE FOOLS ENOUGH TO PUT ON ANYTHING AT THAT RATE	14.975
4959-28865-0014.flac	BUT I NEVER SAW A ORSE SO BAD RIDDEN I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING MY LORD DUKE AGAINST THE MAN BUT IF THAT FELLOW HADN'T BEEN SQUARED OR ELSE WASN'T DRUNK OR ELSE WASN'T OFF HIS HEAD THAT ORSE MUST HAVE WON MY LORD DUKE	15.765
4959-28865-0015.flac	I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RACING MAJOR TIFTO I SUPPOSE NOT YOUR GRACE BUT AS I AND SILVERBRIDGE ARE TOGETHER IN THIS MATTER I THOUGHT I'D JUST LET YOUR GRACE KNOW THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD THING	13.82
4959-28865-0016.flac	I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS YOUR GRACE MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT TIFTO YOU ARE MAKING AN ASS OF YOURSELF SAID SILVERBRIDGE MAKING AN ASS OF MYSELF EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR YES CONSIDERABLY	14.055
4959-28865-0017.flac	I THINK YOU ARE A LITTLE HARD UPON YOUR FRIEND SAID THE DUKE WITH AN ATTEMPT AT A LAUGH	5.905
4959-28865-0018.flac	I THOUGHT MY LORD DUKE YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT LEARNING HOW SILVERBRIDGE WAS GOING ON THIS THE POOR LITTLE MAN SAID ALMOST WITH A WHINE HIS PARTNER'S ROUGHNESS HAD KNOCKED OUT OF HIM NEARLY ALL THE COURAGE WHICH BACCHUS HAD GIVEN HIM	15.83
4959-28865-0019.flac	SO I DO ANYTHING THAT INTERESTS HIM INTERESTS ME BUT PERHAPS OF ALL HIS PURSUITS RACING IS THE ONE TO WHICH I AM LEAST ABLE TO LEND AN ATTENTIVE EAR THAT EVERY HORSE HAS A HEAD	14.11
4959-28865-0020.flac	AND THAT ALL DID HAVE TAILS TILL THEY WERE ILL USED IS THE EXTENT OF MY STABLE KNOWLEDGE VERY GOOD INDEED MY LORD DUKE VERY GOOD INDEED HA HA HA ALL HORSES HAVE HEADS AND ALL HAVE TAILS HEADS AND TAILS	14.875

4959-28865-0022.flac	HAVING BEEN MADE SUPREMELY HAPPY BY WHAT HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN THE DUKE'S JOKE NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD REMEMBER THE SNUBBING AND WOULD BE EVEN WITH SILVERBRIDGE SOME DAY DID LORD SILVERBRIDGE THINK THAT HE WAS GOING TO LOOK AFTER HIS LORDSHIP'S ORSES	15.985
4959-28865-0023.flac	AND DO THIS ALWAYS ON THE SQUARE AND THEN BE SNUBBED FOR DOING IT I AM VERY SORRY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE COME IN TO TROUBLE YOU SAID THE SON HE HAS NOT TROUBLED ME MUCH I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TROUBLED YOU	14.72
4959-28865-0024.flac	IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN I WILL WALK WITH YOU SILVERBRIDGE OF COURSE HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEY STARTED TOGETHER	9.275
4959-28865-0025.flac	THAT MAN DID NOT TROUBLE ME SILVERBRIDGE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER SUCH AN ACQUAINTANCE MUST NOT BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU I'M NOT VERY PROUD OF HIM SIR BUT I THINK ONE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF ONE'S FRIENDS HE ISN'T MY FRIEND IN THAT WAY AT ALL	15.445
4959-28865-0026.flac	IN WHAT WAY THEN HE UNDERSTANDS RACING HE IS THE PARTNER OF YOUR PLEASURE THEN THE MAN IN WHOSE SOCIETY YOU LOVE TO ENJOY THE RECREATION OF THE RACE COURSE	13.37
4959-28865-0027.flac	IT IS SIR BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS IT I THOUGHT THAT A GENTLEMAN ON THE TURF WOULD HAVE A TRAINER FOR THAT PURPOSE NOT A COMPANION YOU MEAN TO IMPLY THAT YOU CAN SAVE MONEY BY LEAGUING YOURSELF WITH MAJOR TIFTO NO SIR INDEED	16.21
4959-28865-0028.flac	IF YOU ASSOCIATE WITH HIM NOT FOR PLEASURE THEN IT SURELY MUST BE FOR PROFIT THAT YOU SHOULD DO THE FORMER WOULD BE TO ME SO SURPRISING THAT I MUST REGARD IT AS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD DO THE LATTER IS I THINK A REPROACH	15.535
4959-28865-0029.flac	THIS HE SAID WITH NO TONE OF ANGER IN HIS VOICE SO GENTLY THAT SILVERBRIDGE AT FIRST HARDLY UNDERSTOOD IT BUT GRADUALLY ALL THAT WAS MEANT CAME IN UPON HIM AND HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF	14.44
4959-28865-0030.flac	HE IS BAD HE SAID AT LAST WHETHER HE BE BAD I WILL NOT SAY BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU CAN GAIN NOTHING BY HIS COMPANIONSHIP I WILL GET RID OF HIM SAID SILVERBRIDGE AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE	15.44
4959-28865-0031.flac	I CANNOT DO SO AT ONCE BUT I WILL DO IT IT WILL BE BETTER I THINK TREGEAR HAS BEEN TELLING ME THE SAME THING IS HE OBJECTIONABLE TO MISTER TREGEAR ASKED THE DUKE OH YES TREGEAR CANNOT BEAR HIM	16.29
4959-28865-0032.flac	I DO NOT DENY THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WELL BUT SO ALSO IS YOUR GROOM LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT HIM AND SO IT IS TO BE MABEL GREX I DID NOT SAY SO SIR	14.42
4959-28865-0033.flac	HOW CAN I ANSWER FOR HER ONLY IT WAS SO PLEASANT FOR ME TO KNOW THAT YOU WOULD APPROVE IF IT SHOULD COME OFF YES I WILL APPROVE WHEN SHE HAS ACCEPTED YOU BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WILL	13.76
4959-28865-0034.flac	IF SHE SHOULD TELL HER THAT I WILL GO TO HER AT ONCE IT WILL BE MUCH TO HAVE A NEW DAUGHTER VERY MUCH THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A WIFE WHERE WOULD SHE LIKE TO LIVE	10.505
4959-28865-0035.flac	I DARE SAY NOT I DARE SAY NOT SAID THE DUKE GATHERUM IS ALWAYS THOUGHT TO BE DULL	6.89
4959-28865-0036.flac	HAVE YOU ASKED HER NO SIR BUT NOBODY EVER DID LIKE GATHERUM I SUPPOSE NOT AND YET SILVERBRIDGE WHAT A SUM OF MONEY IT COST I BELIEVE IT DID	12.945
4959-28865-0037.flac	ALL VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT THE DUKE NO DOUBT WAS THINKING OF CERTAIN SCENES PASSED AT THE GREAT HOUSE IN QUESTION WHICH SCENES HAD NOT BEEN DELIGHTFUL TO HIM NO I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WOULD WISH TO LIVE AT GATHERUM	15.76
4959-28865-0038.flac	THE HORNS WAS GIVEN EXPRESSLY BY MY UNCLE TO YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND I SHOULD LIKE MARY TO HAVE THE PLACE CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD LIVE AMONG YOUR TENANTRY I DON'T CARE SO VERY MUCH FOR MATCHING	14.065
4959-28865-0039.flac	IT IS THE ONE PLACE YOU DO LIKE SIR HOWEVER WE CAN MANAGE ALL THAT CARLTON TERRACE I DO NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE BUT IT IS A GOOD HOUSE	10.68
4959-28865-0040.flac	WHEN IT IS SETTLED LET ME KNOW AT ONCE BUT IF IT SHOULD NEVER BE SETTLED I WILL ASK NO QUESTIONS BUT IF IT BE SETTLED TELL ME THEN IN PALACE YARD HE WAS TURNING TO GO	13.165
4959-28865-0041.flac	BUT BEFORE HE DID SO HE SAID ANOTHER WORD LEANING ON HIS SON'S SHOULDER I DO NOT THINK THAT MABEL GREX AND MAJOR TIFTO WOULD DO WELL TOGETHER AT ALL THERE SHALL BE AN END TO THAT SIR GOD BLESS YOU MY BOY SAID THE DUKE	15.915
4959-28865-0042.flac	LORD SILVERBRIDGE SAT IN THE HOUSE OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY IN THE SMOKING ROOM OF THE HOUSE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THINKING OVER ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS FATHER	11.82
4959-28865-0043.flac	BUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT IT HAD ALL COME OUT NOW AT ANY RATE IT WAS DECIDED FOR HIM THAT HE MUST IN SET TERMS ASK HER TO BE HIS WIFE THE SCENE WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED HAD MADE HIM THOROUGHLY SICK OF MAJOR TIFTO	14.78
4959-28865-0044.flac	HE MUST GET RID OF THE MAJOR AND THERE COULD BE NO WAY OF DOING THIS AT ONCE SO EASY AND SO LITTLE OPEN TO OBSERVATION AS MARRIAGE IF HE WERE BUT ONCE ENGAGED TO MABEL GREX THE DISMISSAL OF TIFTO WOULD BE QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE	16.185
4959-28894-0000.flac	THERE WERE NINE DAYS OF THIS WORK DURING WHICH LORD SILVERBRIDGE BECAME VERY POPULAR AND MADE MANY SPEECHES TREGEAR DID NOT WIN HALF SO MANY HEARTS OR RECOMMEND HIMSELF SO THOROUGHLY TO THE POLITICAL PREDILECTIONS OF THE BOROUGH	15.225
4959-28894-0001.flac	BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS RETURNED IT WOULD PROBABLY BE UNJUST TO ATTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS CHIEFLY TO THE YOUNG LORD'S ELOQUENCE IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT DUE TO THE STRONG RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF THE RECTOR	13.135
4959-28894-0002.flac	IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT EVEN THE THOUGHTFUL POLITICAL CONVICTIONS OF THE CANDIDATE DID NOT ALTOGETHER PRODUCE THE RESULT IT WAS THAT CHIEF MAN AMONG THE CANDIDATE'S GUIDES AND FRIENDS THAT LEADING PHILOSOPHER	14.145
4959-28894-0003.flac	WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW ANYBODY TO GO HOME FROM THE RAIN AND WHO KEPT HIS EYES SO SHARPLY OPEN TO THE PECUNIARY DOINGS OF THE CARBOTTLEITES THAT MISTER CARBOTTLE'S GUIDES AND FRIENDS HAD HARDLY DARED TO SPEND A SHILLING	13.605
4959-28894-0004.flac	IT WAS HE WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN EFFICACIOUS IN EVERY ATTEMPT THEY HAD MADE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY THEY HAD BEEN LOOKED INTO AND CIRCUMVENTED AS MISTER CARBOTTLE HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO POLPENNO ON PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT SPEND MONEY	15.515
4959-28894-0005.flac	AS HE HAD NOTHING BUT HIS MONEY TO RECOMMEND HIM AND AS HE HAD NOT SPENT IT THE FREE AND INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF THE BOROUGH HAD NOT SEEN THEIR WAY TO VOTE FOR HIM THEREFORE THE CONSERVATIVES WERE VERY ELATE WITH THEIR TRIUMPH	14.985
4959-28894-0006.flac	THERE WAS A GREAT CONSERVATIVE REACTION BUT THE ELECTIONEERING GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND IN THE HUMBLE RETIREMENT OF HIS OWN HOME HE WAS A TAILOR IN THE TOWN	11.975
4959-28894-0007.flac	WHOSE ASSISTANCE AT SUCH PERIODS HAD LONG BEEN IN REQUISITION HE KNEW VERY WELL HOW THE SEAT HAD BEEN SECURED TEN SHILLINGS A HEAD WOULD HAVE SENT THREE HUNDRED TRUE LIBERALS TO THE BALLOT BOXES	14.47
4959-28894-0008.flac	THE MODE OF DISTRIBUTING THE MONEY HAD BEEN ARRANGED BUT THE CONSERVATIVE TAILOR HAD BEEN TOO ACUTE AND NOT HALF A SOVEREIGN COULD BE PASSED THE TAILOR GOT TWENTY FIVE POUNDS FOR HIS WORK AND THAT WAS SMUGGLED IN AMONG THE BILLS FOR PRINTING	15.82
4959-28894-0009.flac	MISTER WILLIAMS HOWEVER WAS SURE THAT HE HAD SO OPENED OUT THE INIQUITIES OF THE DISSENTERS AS TO HAVE CONVINCED THE BOROUGH YES EVERY SALEM AND ZION AND EBENEZER IN HIS LARGE PARISH WOULD BE CLOSED	14.96
4959-28894-0010.flac	IT IS A GREAT THING FOR THE COUNTRY SAID MISTER WILLIAMS HE'LL MAKE A CAPITAL MEMBER SAID SILVERBRIDGE CLAPPING HIS FRIEND ON THE BACK I HOPE HE'LL NEVER FORGET SAID MISTER WILLIAMS	12.95
4959-28894-0011.flac	OF THIS BOROUGH WHOM SHOULD THEY ELECT BUT A TREGEAR SAID THE MOTHER FEELING THAT HER RECTOR TOOK TOO MUCH OF THE PRAISE TO HIMSELF I THINK YOU HAVE DONE MORE FOR US THAN ANY ONE ELSE WHISPERED MISS TREGEAR TO THE YOUNG LORD	15.71
4959-28894-0012.flac	WHAT YOU SAID WAS SO REASSURING THE FATHER BEFORE HE WENT TO BED EXPRESSED TO HIS SON WITH SOME TREPIDATION A HOPE THAT ALL THIS WOULD LEAD TO NO GREAT PERMANENT INCREASE OF EXPENDITURE	13.725
4959-28894-0013.flac	THAT EVENING BEFORE HE WENT TO BED LORD SILVERBRIDGE WROTE TO HIS FATHER AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT POLPENNO POLWENNING FIFTEENTH DECEMBER MY DEAR FATHER	12.59
4959-28894-0014.flac	AMONG US ALL WE HAVE MANAGED TO RETURN TREGEAR I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT BE QUITE PLEASED BECAUSE IT WILL BE A VOTE LOST TO YOUR PARTY BUT I REALLY THINK THAT HE IS JUST THE FELLOW TO BE IN PARLIAMENT	12.37
4959-28894-0015.flac	IF HE WERE ON YOUR SIDE I'M SURE HE'S THE KIND OF MAN YOU'D LIKE TO BRING INTO OFFICE HE IS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THOSE SORT OF THINGS HE SAYS THAT IF THERE WERE NO CONSERVATIVES SUCH LIBERALS AS YOU AND MISTER MONK WOULD BE DESTROYED BY THE JACOBINS	15.0949375
4959-28894-0016.flac	THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT WHETHER A MAN IS A CONSERVATIVE OR NOT HIMSELF I SUPPOSE THERE OUGHT TO BE CONSERVATIVES	7.5250625
4959-28894-0017.flac	THE DUKE AS HE READ THIS MADE A MEMORANDUM IN HIS OWN MIND THAT HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HIS SON THAT EVERY CARRIAGE SHOULD HAVE A DRAG TO ITS WHEELS BUT THAT AN AMBITIOUS SOUL WOULD CHOOSE TO BE THE COACHMAN RATHER THAN THE DRAG	14.07
4959-28894-0018.flac	IT WAS BEASTLY WORK THE DUKE MADE ANOTHER MEMORANDUM TO INSTRUCT HIS SON THAT NO GENTLEMAN ABOVE THE AGE OF A SCHOOLBOY SHOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO USE SUCH A WORD IN SUCH A SENSE	11.99
4959-28894-0019.flac	WE HAD TO GO ABOUT IN THE RAIN UP TO OUR KNEES IN MUD FOR EIGHT OR NINE DAYS ALWAYS SAYING THE SAME THING AND OF COURSE ALL THAT WE SAID WAS BOSH ANOTHER MEMORANDUM OR RATHER TWO	14.35
4959-28894-0020.flac	ONE AS TO THE SLANG AND ANOTHER AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF TEACHING SOMETHING TO THE POOR VOTERS ON SUCH OCCASIONS OUR ONLY COMFORT WAS THAT THE CARBOTTLE PEOPLE WERE QUITE AS BADLY OFF AS US	13.46
4959-28894-0021.flac	ANOTHER MEMORANDUM AS TO THE GRAMMAR THE ABSENCE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY DID NOT AT THE MOMENT AFFECT THE DUKE I MADE EVER SO MANY SPEECHES TILL AT LAST IT SEEMED TO BE QUITE EASY	12.85
4959-28894-0022.flac	HERE THERE WAS A VERY GRAVE MEMORANDUM SPEECHES EASY TO YOUNG SPEAKERS ARE GENERALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO OLD LISTENERS BUT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL BOSH THIS REQUIRED NO SEPARATE MEMORANDUM	14.15
4959-28894-0023.flac	I HAVE PROMISED TO GO UP TO TOWN WITH TREGEAR FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER THAT I WILL STICK TO MY PURPOSE OF GOING TO MATCHING AGAIN I WILL BE THERE ABOUT THE TWENTY SECOND AND WILL THEN STAY OVER CHRISTMAS	13.44
4959-28894-0024.flac	AFTER THAT I AM GOING INTO THE BRAKE COUNTRY FOR SOME HUNTING IT IS SUCH A SHAME TO HAVE A LOT OF HORSES AND NEVER TO RIDE THEM YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE SON SILVERBRIDGE	11.63
4959-28894-0025.flac	THE LAST SENTENCE GAVE RISE IN THE DUKE'S MIND TO THE NECESSITY OF A VERY ELABORATE MEMORANDUM ON THE SUBJECT OF AMUSEMENTS GENERALLY BY THE SAME POST ANOTHER LETTER WENT FROM POLPENNO TO MATCHING	13.64
4959-28894-0026.flac	WHICH ALSO GAVE RISE TO SOME MENTAL MEMORANDA IT WAS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR MABEL I AM A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS	10.99
4959-28894-0027.flac	I HAVE SOMETIMES REGARDED MYSELF AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST PECULIARLY UNFORTUNATE MEN IN THE WORLD AND YET NOW I HAVE ACHIEVED THAT WHICH ALL COMMONERS IN ENGLAND THINK TO BE THE GREATEST HONOUR WITHIN THEIR REACH	13.105
4959-28894-0028.flac	AND HAVE DONE SO AT AN AGE AT WHICH VERY FEW ACHIEVE IT BUT THE SONS OF THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL I NOW COME TO MY MISFORTUNES I KNOW THAT AS A POOR MAN I OUGHT NOT TO BE A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT	14.235
4959-28894-0029.flac	I OUGHT TO BE EARNING MY BREAD AS A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE WHAT I AM AND WHEN I AM FORTY I SHALL FIND THAT I HAVE EATEN UP ALL MY GOOD THINGS INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM TO EAT I HAVE ONE CHANCE BEFORE ME	15.895
4959-28894-0030.flac	YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT THAT IS TELL HER THAT MY PRIDE IN BEING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IS MUCH MORE ON HER BEHALF THAN ON MY OWN THE MAN WHO DARES TO LOVE HER OUGHT AT ANY RATE TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD IF IT MIGHT BE	15.095
4959-28894-0031.flac	IF EVER IT MAY BE I SHOULD WISH TO BE SOMETHING FOR HER SAKE I AM SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD OF MY SUCCESS YOURSELF FOR MY OWN SAKE YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND COUSIN FRANCIS TREGEAR	13.95
4959-28894-0032.flac	THE FIRST MENTAL MEMORANDUM IN REGARD TO THIS CAME FROM THE WRITER'S ASSERTION THAT HE AT FORTY WOULD HAVE EATEN UP ALL HIS GOOD THINGS NO HE BEING A MAN MIGHT MAKE HIS WAY TO GOOD THINGS THOUGH HE WAS NOT BORN TO THEM	15.26
4959-28894-0033.flac	HE SURELY WOULD WIN HIS GOOD THINGS FOR HIMSELF BUT WHAT GOOD THINGS WERE IN STORE FOR HER WHAT CHANCE OF SUCCESS WAS THERE FOR HER BUT THE REFLECTION	11.375
4959-28894-0034.flac	WHICH WAS THE MOST BITTER TO HER OF ALL CAME FROM HER ASSURANCE THAT HIS LOVE FOR THAT OTHER GIRL WAS SO GENUINE EVEN WHEN HE WAS WRITING TO HER THERE WAS NO SPARK LEFT OF THE OLD ROMANCE SOME HINT OF A RECOLLECTION OF PAST FEELINGS	16.6099375
4959-28894-0035.flac	SOME HALF CONCEALED REFERENCE TO THE FORMER PASSION MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HIM SHE AS A WOMAN AS A WOMAN ALL WHOSE FORTUNE MUST DEPEND ON MARRIAGE COULD INDULGE IN NO SUCH ALLUSIONS BUT SURELY HE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN SO HARD	15.9650625
4959-28894-0036.flac	BUT STILL THERE WAS ANOTHER MEMORANDUM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT SHE WOULD DO ALL THAT HE DESIRED AS FAR AS IT WAS IN HER POWER SHE WAS ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD MARRY LADY MARY PALLISER	12.13
4959-28894-0037.flac	THOUGH SO ANXIOUS ALSO THAT SOMETHING OF HIS LOVE SHOULD REMAIN WITH HERSELF SHE WAS QUITE WILLING TO CONVEY THAT MESSAGE IF IT MIGHT BE DONE WITHOUT OFFENCE TO THE DUKE SHE WAS THERE WITH THE OBJECT OF INGRATIATING HERSELF WITH THE DUKE	15.3
4959-28894-0038.flac	SHE MUST NOT IMPEDE HER FAVOUR WITH THE DUKE BY MAKING HERSELF THE MEDIUM OF ANY SECRET COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN MARY AND HER LOVER BUT HOW SHOULD SHE SERVE TREGEAR WITHOUT RISK OF OFFENDING THE DUKE SHE READ THE LETTER AGAIN AND AGAIN	15.5
4959-28894-0039.flac	AND THINKING IT TO BE A GOOD LETTER SHE DETERMINED TO SHOW IT TO THE DUKE MISTER TREGEAR HAS GOT IN AT POLPENNO SHE SAID ON THE DAY ON WHICH SHE AND THE DUKE HAD RECEIVED THEIR LETTERS SO I HEAR FROM SILVERBRIDGE	15.04
4959-28894-0040.flac	IT WILL BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM I SUPPOSE I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE DUKE COLDLY HE IS MY COUSIN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS WELFARE THAT IS NATURAL	13.2
4959-28894-0041.flac	AND A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT WILL GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO CERTAINLY IT OUGHT SAID THE DUKE I DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN IDLE MAN TO THIS THE DUKE MADE NO ANSWER HE DID NOT WISH TO BE MADE TO TALK ABOUT TREGEAR	14.365
4959-28894-0042.flac	MAY I TELL YOU WHY I SAY ALL THIS SHE ASKED SOFTLY PRESSING HER HAND ON THE DUKE'S ARM EVER SO GENTLY TO THIS THE DUKE ASSENTED BUT STILL COLDLY BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO	14.685
4959-28894-0043.flac	WOULD YOU MIND READING THAT LETTER OF COURSE YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT FRANK AND I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ALMOST AS BROTHER AND SISTER THE DUKE TOOK THE LETTER IN HIS HAND AND DID READ IT VERY SLOWLY	12.635
4959-28894-0044.flac	WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOUNG MEN WITHOUT MEANS GOING INTO PARLIAMENT IS TRUE ENOUGH THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING BUT AS THE DUKE WENT ON READING MABEL DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ARGUE THE MATTER	12.955
4959-28894-0045.flac	HE HAD TO READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH TWICE BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE DID READ IT TWICE AND THEN FOLDING THE LETTER VERY SLOWLY GAVE IT BACK TO HIS COMPANION WHAT OUGHT I TO DO ASKED LADY MABEL	14.21
4959-28894-0046.flac	AS YOU AND I MY DEAR ARE FRIENDS I THINK THAT ANY CARRYING OF A MESSAGE TO MARY WOULD BE BREAKING CONFIDENCE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO MARY ABOUT MISTER TREGEAR THEN HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT	15.27
5287-39165-0011.flac	NEVER LET THE ESTATE DECREASE IN YOUR HANDS IT IS ONLY BY SUCH RESOLUTIONS AS THAT THAT ENGLISH NOBLEMEN AND ENGLISH GENTLEMEN CAN PRESERVE THEIR COUNTRY I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE PROPERTY CHANGING HANDS	13.135
5287-39165-0012.flac	WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE LAND IN THE MARKET SOMETIMES SO THAT THE MILLIONNAIRES MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY GOD FORBID THAT YOURS SHOULD BE THERE AND THE WIDOW MADE A LITTLE MENTAL PRAYER	13.195
5287-39165-0013.flac	THAT HER SON'S ACRES MIGHT BE PROTECTED FROM THE MILLIONNAIRES AND OTHER PHILISTINES WHY YES I DON'T EXACTLY WANT TO SEE A JEW TAILOR INVESTING HIS EARNINGS AT LUFTON SAID THE LORD HEAVEN FORBID SAID THE WIDOW	14.655
5287-39165-0014.flac	ALL THIS AS I HAVE SAID WAS VERY NICE IT WAS MANIFEST TO HER LADYSHIP FROM HIS LORDSHIP'S WAY OF TALKING THAT NO VITAL INJURY HAD AS YET BEEN DONE HE HAD NO CARES ON HIS MIND	13.925
5287-39165-0015.flac	AND SPOKE FREELY ABOUT THE PROPERTY BUT NEVERTHELESS THERE WERE CLOUDS EVEN NOW AT THIS PERIOD OF BLISS WHICH SOMEWHAT OBSCURED THE BRILLIANCY OF LADY LUFTON'S SKY	11.385
5287-39165-0016.flac	WHY WAS LUDOVIC SO SLOW IN THAT AFFAIR OF GRISELDA GRANTLY WHY SO OFTEN IN THESE LATTER WINTER DAYS DID HE SAUNTER OVER TO THE PARSONAGE AND THEN THAT TERRIBLE VISIT TO GATHERUM CASTLE	13.89
5287-39165-0017.flac	WHAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN AT GATHERUM CASTLE SHE NEVER KNEW WE HOWEVER ARE MORE INTRUSIVE LESS DELICATE IN OUR INQUIRIES AND WE CAN SAY HE HAD A VERY BAD DAY'S SPORT WITH THE WEST BARSETSHIRE	15.94
5287-39165-0018.flac	THE COUNTY IS ALTOGETHER SHORT OF FOXES AND SOME ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE MATTER MUST TAKE THAT POINT UP BEFORE THEY CAN DO ANY GOOD AND AFTER THAT HE HAD HAD RATHER A DULL DINNER WITH THE DUKE SOWERBY HAD BEEN THERE	15.74
5287-39165-0019.flac	AND IN THE EVENING HE AND SOWERBY HAD PLAYED BILLIARDS SOWERBY HAD WON A POUND OR TWO AND THAT HAD BEEN THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE DONE BUT THOSE SAUNTERINGS OVER TO THE PARSONAGE MIGHT BE MORE DANGEROUS	14.31
5287-39165-0020.flac	NOT THAT IT EVER OCCURRED TO LADY LUFTON AS POSSIBLE THAT HER SON SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH LUCY ROBARTS LUCY'S PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS WERE NOT OF A NATURE TO GIVE GROUND FOR SUCH A FEAR AS THAT BUT HE MIGHT TURN THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH HIS CHATTER	15.68
5287-39165-0021.flac	SHE MIGHT BE FOOL ENOUGH TO FANCY ANY FOLLY AND MOREOVER PEOPLE WOULD TALK WHY SHOULD HE GO TO THE PARSONAGE NOW MORE FREQUENTLY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE LUCY CAME THERE	13.16
5287-39165-0022.flac	AND THEN HER LADYSHIP IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME TROUBLE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE HER INVITATIONS TO THE PARSONAGE THESE HITHERTO HAD BEEN VERY FREQUENT AND SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THINKING THAT THEY COULD HARDLY BE TOO MUCH SO	15.22
5287-39165-0023.flac	BUT NOW SHE WAS ALMOST AFRAID TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM SHE COULD NOT ASK THE PARSON AND HIS WIFE WITHOUT LUCY AND WHEN LUCY WAS THERE HER SON WOULD PASS THE GREATER PART OF THE EVENING IN TALKING TO HER OR PLAYING CHESS WITH HER	14.36
5287-39165-0024.flac	NOW THIS DID DISTURB LADY LUFTON NOT A LITTLE AND THEN LUCY TOOK IT ALL SO QUIETLY ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL AT FRAMLEY SHE HAD BEEN SO SHY SO SILENT	11.6
5287-39165-0025.flac	THAT LADY LUFTON HAD SYMPATHIZED WITH HER AND ENCOURAGED HER SHE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MODERATE THE BLAZE OF HER OWN SPLENDOUR IN ORDER THAT LUCY'S UNACCUSTOMED EYES MIGHT NOT BE DAZZLED BUT ALL THIS WAS CHANGED NOW	14.42
5287-39165-0026.flac	LUCY COULD LISTEN TO THE YOUNG LORD'S VOICE BY THE HOUR TOGETHER WITHOUT BEING DAZZLED IN THE LEAST UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TWO THINGS OCCURRED TO HER SHE WOULD SPEAK EITHER TO HER SON OR TO FANNY ROBARTS AND BY A LITTLE DIPLOMACY	16.005
5287-39165-0027.flac	HAVE THIS EVIL REMEDIED AND THEN SHE HAD TO DETERMINE ON WHICH STEP SHE WOULD TAKE NOTHING COULD BE MORE REASONABLE THAN LUDOVIC SO AT LEAST SHE SAID TO HERSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT THEN LUDOVIC UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ABOUT SUCH MATTERS	16.615
5287-39165-0028.flac	A HABIT INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER OF TAKING THE BIT BETWEEN HIS TEETH WHENEVER HE SUSPECTED INTERFERENCE DRIVE HIM GENTLY WITHOUT PULLING HIS MOUTH ABOUT AND YOU MIGHT TAKE HIM ANYWHERE ALMOST AT ANY PACE BUT A SMART TOUCH	16.13
5287-39165-0029.flac	LET IT BE EVER SO SLIGHT WOULD BRING HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THEN IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION WHETHER YOU COULD GET HIM ANOTHER MILE THAT DAY SO THAT ON THE WHOLE LADY LUFTON THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER PLAN WOULD BE THE BEST I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT LADY LUFTON WAS RIGHT	15.795
5287-39165-0030.flac	SHE GOT FANNY UP INTO HER OWN DEN ONE AFTERNOON AND SEATED HER DISCREETLY IN AN EASY ARM CHAIR MAKING HER GUEST TAKE OFF HER BONNET AND SHOWING BY VARIOUS SIGNS THAT THE VISIT WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF GREAT MOMENT FANNY SHE SAID	16.265
5287-39165-0031.flac	AND NECESSARY TO MENTION AND YET IT IS A VERY DELICATE AFFAIR TO SPEAK OF FANNY OPENED HER EYES AND SAID THAT SHE HOPED THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG NO MY DEAR I THINK NOTHING IS WRONG	13.12
5287-39165-0032.flac	I HOPE SO AND I THINK I MAY SAY I'M SURE OF IT BUT THEN IT'S ALWAYS WELL TO BE ON ONE'S GUARD YES IT IS SAID FANNY WHO KNEW THAT SOMETHING UNPLEASANT WAS COMING SOMETHING AS TO WHICH SHE MIGHT PROBABLY BE CALLED UPON TO DIFFER FROM HER LADYSHIP	16.125
5287-39165-0033.flac	AND INDEED LADY LUFTON HAD A WORD OR TWO TO SAY ON THAT SUBJECT ALSO ONLY NOT EXACTLY NOW A HUNTING PARSON WAS NOT AT ALL TO HER TASTE BUT THAT MATTER MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN ABEYANCE FOR A FEW DAYS	14.805
5287-39165-0034.flac	NOW FANNY YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL LIKED YOUR SISTER IN LAW LUCY VERY MUCH	5.81
5287-39165-0035.flac	AND SHE KNEW THE REST AS WELL AS THOUGH IT HAD ALL BEEN SPOKEN I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT FOR I AM SURE WE HAVE SHOWN IT YOU HAVE INDEED AS YOU ALWAYS DO AND YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT I AM GOING TO COMPLAIN CONTINUED LADY LUFTON	16.005
5287-39165-0036.flac	I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SAID FANNY SPEAKING BY NO MEANS IN A DEFIANT TONE BUT HUMBLY AS IT WERE AND DEPRECATING HER LADYSHIP'S WRATH FANNY HAD GAINED ONE SIGNAL VICTORY OVER LADY LUFTON	14.985
5287-39165-0037.flac	AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WITH A PRUDENCE EQUAL TO HER GENEROSITY FELT THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE SUBMISSIVE IT MIGHT PERHAPS NOT BE LONG BEFORE SHE WOULD BE EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO CONQUER AGAIN	12.84
5287-39165-0038.flac	WELL NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS SAID LADY LUFTON NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF BUT A LITTLE CHAT BETWEEN YOU AND ME MAY PERHAPS SET MATTERS RIGHT WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT BECOME TROUBLESOME IS IT ABOUT LUCY	15.82
5287-39165-0039.flac	YES MY DEAR ABOUT LUCY SHE IS A VERY NICE GOOD GIRL AND A CREDIT TO HER FATHER AND A GREAT COMFORT TO US SAID FANNY I AM SURE SHE IS SHE MUST BE A VERY PLEASANT COMPANION TO YOU AND SO USEFUL ABOUT THE CHILDREN BUT	16.45
5287-39165-0040.flac	AND THEN LADY LUFTON PAUSED FOR A MOMENT FOR SHE ELOQUENT AND DISCREET AS SHE ALWAYS WAS FELT HERSELF RATHER AT A LOSS FOR WORDS TO EXPRESS HER EXACT MEANING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITHOUT HER SAID FANNY	15.365
5287-39165-0041.flac	SPEAKING WITH THE OBJECT OF ASSISTING HER LADYSHIP IN HER EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS SHE AND LORD LUFTON ARE GETTING INTO THE WAY OF BEING TOO MUCH TOGETHER OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER TOO EXCLUSIVELY	13.935
5287-39165-0042.flac	IT IS NOT THAT I SUSPECT ANY EVIL I DON'T THINK THAT I AM SUSPICIOUS BY NATURE	5.125
5287-39165-0043.flac	SAID FANNY BUT THEY WILL EACH OF THEM GET WRONG IDEAS ABOUT THE OTHER AND ABOUT THEMSELVES LUCY WILL PERHAPS THINK THAT LUDOVIC MEANS MORE THAN HE DOES AND LUDOVIC WILL	13.74
5287-39165-0044.flac	BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SO EASY TO SAY WHAT LUDOVIC MIGHT DO OR THINK BUT LADY LUFTON WENT ON I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME FANNY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT SENSE AND TACT LUCY IS CLEVER AND AMUSING AND ALL THAT	15.205
5287-39165-0045.flac	AND LUDOVIC LIKE ALL YOUNG MEN IS PERHAPS IGNORANT THAT HIS ATTENTIONS MAY BE TAKEN TO MEAN MORE THAN HE INTENDS	7.955
5287-39165-0046.flac	IF I THOUGHT IT HAD COME TO THAT I SHOULD RECOMMEND THAT SHE SHOULD BE SENT AWAY ALTOGETHER I AM SURE SHE IS NOT SO FOOLISH AS THAT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING IN IT AT ALL LADY LUFTON I DON'T THINK THERE IS MY DEAR	14.5
5287-39165-0047.flac	BUT STILL IT MAY BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD JUST SAY A WORD TO HER A LITTLE MANAGEMENT NOW AND THEN IN SUCH MATTERS IS SO USEFUL BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY TO HER	11.7400625
5287-39165-0048.flac	JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT ANY YOUNG LADY WHO TALKS SO MUCH TO THE SAME YOUNG GENTLEMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE OBSERVED THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE HER OF SETTING HER CAP AT LORD LUFTON NOT THAT I SUSPECT HER I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TOO MUCH PROPER FEELING	16.055
5287-39165-0049.flac	AND HER PRINCIPLES ARE UPRIGHT BUT PEOPLE WILL TALK OF HER YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT FANNY AS WELL AS I DO FANNY COULD NOT HELP MEDITATING WHETHER PROPER FEELING EDUCATION AND UPRIGHT PRINCIPLES	13.875
5287-39165-0050.flac	DID FORBID LUCY ROBARTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH LORD LUFTON BUT HER DOUBTS ON THIS SUBJECT IF SHE HELD ANY WERE NOT COMMUNICATED TO HER LADYSHIP IT HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO HER MIND	12.75
5287-39165-0051.flac	THAT A MATCH WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN LORD LUFTON AND LUCY ROBARTS NOR HAD SHE THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO ENCOURAGE IT NOW THAT THE IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HER ON SUCH A MATTER SHE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH LADY LUFTON THOUGH SHE DID NOT COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HER	16.07
5287-39165-0052.flac	AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF ANY INTERFERENCE NEVERTHELESS SHE AT ONCE OFFERED TO SPEAK TO LUCY I DON'T THINK THAT LUCY HAS ANY IDEA IN HER HEAD UPON THE SUBJECT SAID MISSUS ROBARTS I DARE SAY NOT I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE HAS	16.115
5287-39165-0053.flac	BUT YOUNG LADIES SOMETIMES ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FALL IN LOVE AND THEN TO THINK THEMSELVES VERY ILL USED JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD NO IDEA IN THEIR HEAD I WILL PUT HER ON HER GUARD IF YOU WISH IT LADY LUFTON EXACTLY MY DEAR	14.75
5287-39165-0054.flac	THAT IS JUST IT PUT HER ON HER GUARD THAT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY SHE IS A DEAR GOOD CLEVER GIRL AND IT WOULD BE VERY SAD IF ANYTHING WERE TO INTERRUPT OUR COMFORTABLE WAY OF GETTING ON WITH HER	12.26
5287-39165-0055.flac	IF LUCY WOULD PERSIST IN SECURING TO HERSELF SO MUCH OF LORD LUFTON'S TIME AND ATTENTION HER VISITS TO FRAMLEY COURT MUST BECOME LESS FREQUENT LADY LUFTON WOULD DO MUCH VERY MUCH INDEED FOR HER FRIENDS AT THE PARSONAGE	14.885
5287-39165-0056.flac	BUT NOT EVEN FOR THEM COULD SHE PERMIT HER SON'S PROSPECTS IN LIFE TO BE ENDANGERED THERE WAS NOTHING MORE SAID BETWEEN THEM AND MISSUS ROBARTS GOT UP TO TAKE HER LEAVE HAVING PROMISED TO SPEAK TO LUCY	12.51
5287-39165-0057.flac	YOU MANAGE EVERYTHING SO PERFECTLY SAID LADY LUFTON AS SHE PRESSED MISSUS ROBARTS HAND THAT I AM QUITE AT EASE NOW THAT I FIND YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT EXACTLY AGREE WITH HER LADYSHIP	13.845
5287-39165-0058.flac	BUT SHE HARDLY THOUGHT IT WORTH HER WHILE TO SAY SO MISSUS ROBARTS IMMEDIATELY STARTED OFF ON HER WALK TO HER OWN HOME AND WHEN SHE HAD GOT OUT OF THE GROUNDS INTO THE ROAD WHERE IT MAKES A TURN TOWARDS THE PARSONAGE	14.115
5287-39165-0059.flac	NEARLY OPPOSITE TO PODGENS SHOP SHE SAW LORD LUFTON ON HORSEBACK AND LUCY STANDING BESIDE HIM IT WAS ALREADY NEARLY FIVE O'CLOCK AND IT WAS GETTING DUSK BUT AS SHE APPROACHED OR RATHER	13.83
5287-39165-0060.flac	AS SHE CAME SUDDENLY WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM SHE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE IN CLOSE CONVERSATION LORD LUFTON'S FACE WAS TOWARDS HER AND HIS HORSE WAS STANDING STILL HE WAS LEANING OVER TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AND THE WHIP WHICH HE HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND	15.815
5287-39165-0061.flac	HUNG ALMOST OVER HER ARM AND DOWN HER BACK AS THOUGH HIS HAND HAD TOUCHED AND PERHAPS RESTED ON HER SHOULDER SHE WAS STANDING BY HIS SIDE LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE WITH ONE GLOVED HAND RESTING ON THE HORSE'S NECK	14.315
5287-39165-0062.flac	MISSUS ROBARTS AS SHE SAW THEM COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT THERE MIGHT BE CAUSE FOR LADY LUFTON'S FEARS BUT THEN LUCY'S MANNER AS MISSUS ROBARTS APPROACHED WAS CALCULATED TO DISSIPATE ANY SUCH FEARS	13.055
5287-39165-0063.flac	AND TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR THEM SHE DID NOT MOVE FROM HER POSITION OR ALLOW HER HAND TO DROP OR SHOW THAT SHE WAS IN ANY WAY EITHER CONFUSED OR CONSCIOUS SHE STOOD HER GROUND	12.43
5287-39165-0064.flac	LORD LUFTON WANTS ME TO LEARN TO RIDE SAID SHE	4.045
5287-39165-0065.flac	SAID FANNY NOT KNOWING WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE TO SUCH A PROPOSITION YES SAID HE THIS HORSE WOULD CARRY HER BEAUTIFULLY HE IS AS QUIET AS A LAMB AND I MADE GREGORY GO OUT WITH HIM YESTERDAY WITH A SHEET HANGING OVER HIM LIKE A LADY'S HABIT	15.0300625
5287-39165-0066.flac	AND THE MAN GOT UP INTO A LADY'S SADDLE I THINK GREGORY WOULD MAKE A BETTER HAND OF IT THAN LUCY THE HORSE CANTERED WITH HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CARRIED A LADY ALL HIS LIFE AND HIS MOUTH IS LIKE VELVET INDEED THAT IS HIS FAULT HE IS TOO SOFT MOUTHED	16.075
5287-39165-0067.flac	I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING AS A MAN BEING SOFT HEARTED SAID LUCY EXACTLY YOU OUGHT TO RIDE THEM BOTH WITH A VERY LIGHT HAND THEY ARE DIFFICULT CATTLE TO MANAGE BUT VERY PLEASANT WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT	13.95
5287-39165-0068.flac	BUT YOU SEE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT SAID LUCY AS REGARDS THE HORSE YOU WILL LEARN IN TWO DAYS AND I DO HOPE YOU WILL TRY DON'T YOU THINK IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT THING FOR HER MISSUS ROBARTS LUCY HAS GOT NO HABIT SAID MISSUS ROBARTS	15.865
5287-39165-0069.flac	MAKING USE OF THE EXCUSE COMMON ON ALL SUCH OCCASIONS THERE IS ONE OF JUSTINIA'S IN THE HOUSE I KNOW SHE ALWAYS LEAVES ONE HERE IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RIDE WHEN SHE COMES SHE WOULD NOT THINK OF TAKING SUCH A LIBERTY WITH LADY MEREDITH'S THINGS	15.7
5287-39165-0070.flac	SAID FANNY ALMOST FRIGHTENED AT THE PROPOSAL OF COURSE IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION FANNY SAID LUCY NOW SPEAKING RATHER SERIOUSLY IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD NOT TAKE LORD LUFTON'S HORSE IN THE SECOND PLACE I WOULD NOT TAKE LADY MEREDITH'S HABIT	15.905
5287-39165-0071.flac	TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED AND LASTLY IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A GREAT MANY OTHER VERY GOOD REASONS NONSENSE SAID LORD LUFTON A GREAT DEAL OF NONSENSE SAID LUCY LAUGHING BUT ALL OF IT OF LORD LUFTON'S TALKING	15.845
5287-39165-0072.flac	BUT WE ARE GETTING COLD ARE WE NOT FANNY SO WE WILL WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT AND THEN THE TWO LADIES SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND WALKED ON TOWARDS THE PARSONAGE THAT WHICH ASTONISHED MISSUS ROBARTS THE MOST IN ALL THIS	13.725
5287-39165-0073.flac	WAS THE PERFECTLY COLLECTED MANNER IN WHICH LUCY SPOKE AND CONDUCTED HERSELF THIS CONNECTED AS SHE COULD NOT BUT CONNECT IT WITH THE AIR OF CHAGRIN WITH WHICH LORD LUFTON RECEIVED LUCY'S DECISION MADE IT MANIFEST TO MISSUS ROBARTS	15.44
5287-39165-0074.flac	THAT LORD LUFTON WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE LUCY WOULD NOT CONSENT TO LEARN TO RIDE WHEREAS SHE LUCY HERSELF HAD GIVEN HER REFUSAL IN A FIRM AND DECIDED TONE AS THOUGH RESOLVED THAT NOTHING MORE SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT IT	14.195
5287-39165-0075.flac	THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TILL THEY REACHED THE PARSONAGE GATE AND THEN LUCY SAID LAUGHING CAN'T YOU FANCY ME SITTING ON THAT GREAT BIG HORSE	10.1
5287-39165-0076.flac	AND HIS LORDSHIP GIVING ME MY FIRST LESSON I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD LIKE IT SAID FANNY I'M SURE SHE WOULD NOT BUT I WILL NOT TRY HER TEMPER IN THAT RESPECT SOMETIMES I FANCY THAT SHE DOES NOT EVEN LIKE SEEING LORD LUFTON TALKING TO ME	15.39
5287-39165-0077.flac	SHE DOES NOT LIKE IT LUCY WHEN SHE SEES HIM FLIRTING WITH YOU THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID RATHER GRAVELY WHEREAS LUCY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN A HALF BANTERING TONE AS SOON AS EVEN THE WORD FLIRTING WAS OUT OF FANNY'S MOUTH	14.54
5287-39165-0078.flac	SHE HAD WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD CONVEY TO HER SISTER IN LAW AN IDEA OF WHAT LADY LUFTON WOULD DISLIKE BUT IN DOING SO SHE HAD UNINTENTIONALLY BROUGHT AGAINST HER AN ACCUSATION FLIRTING FANNY SAID LUCY	15.14
5287-39165-0079.flac	STANDING STILL IN THE PATH AND LOOKING UP INTO HER COMPANION'S FACE WITH ALL HER EYES	5.095
5287-39165-0080.flac	I DID NOT SAY THAT OR THAT I HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO FLIRT WITH ME I DID NOT MEAN TO SHOCK YOU LUCY WHAT DID YOU MEAN FANNY WHY JUST THIS	10.945
5287-39165-0081.flac	THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD NOT BE PLEASED IF HE PAID YOU MARKED ATTENTIONS AND IF YOU RECEIVED THEM JUST LIKE THAT AFFAIR OF THE RIDING IT WAS BETTER TO DECLINE IT OF COURSE I DECLINED IT OF COURSE I NEVER DREAMT OF ACCEPTING SUCH AN OFFER	14.445
5287-39165-0082.flac	GO RIDING ABOUT THE COUNTRY ON HIS HORSES WHAT HAVE I DONE FANNY THAT YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE SUCH A THING YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING DEAREST	9.475
5287-39165-0083.flac	BECAUSE I WISHED TO PUT YOU ON YOUR GUARD YOU KNOW LUCY THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO FIND FAULT WITH YOU BUT YOU MAY BE SURE AS A RULE	8.795
5287-39165-0084.flac	THEY THEN WALKED UP TO THE HALL DOOR IN SILENCE WHEN THEY HAD REACHED IT LUCY STOOD IN THE DOORWAY INSTEAD OF ENTERING IT AND SAID FANNY LET US TAKE ANOTHER TURN TOGETHER IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED NO I'M NOT TIRED	15.35
5287-39165-0085.flac	IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND YOU AT ONCE AND THEN THEY AGAIN MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOUSE TELL ME TRULY NOW DO YOU THINK THAT LORD LUFTON AND I HAVE BEEN FLIRTING I DO THINK THAT HE IS A LITTLE INCLINED TO FLIRT WITH YOU	14.53
5287-39165-0086.flac	AND LADY LUFTON HAS BEEN ASKING YOU TO LECTURE ME ABOUT IT POOR MISSUS ROBARTS HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY SHE THOUGHT WELL OF ALL THE PERSONS CONCERNED AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO BEHAVE WELL BY ALL OF THEM	12.99
5287-39165-0087.flac	WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO CREATE NO ILL FEELING AND WISHED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE AND ON GOOD TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BUT YET THE TRUTH WAS FORCED OUT OF HER WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED SO SUDDENLY NOT TO LECTURE YOU LUCY	15.055
5287-39165-0088.flac	SHE SAID AT LAST WELL TO PREACH TO ME OR TO TALK TO ME OR TO GIVE ME A LESSON TO SAY SOMETHING THAT SHALL DRIVE ME TO PUT MY BACK UP AGAINST LORD LUFTON TO CAUTION YOU DEAREST	13.015
5287-39165-0089.flac	HAD YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE FELT ANGRY WITH LADY LUFTON WELL TO CAUTION ME	6.395
5287-39165-0090.flac	ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN IS VERY RICH AND A LORD AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING NOBODY FOR A MOMENT ATTRIBUTES ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU LUCY ANYTHING WRONG NO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE ANYTHING WRONG EVEN IF I WERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM	15.775
5287-39165-0091.flac	I WONDER WHETHER THEY CAUTIONED GRISELDA GRANTLY WHEN SHE WAS HERE I SUPPOSE WHEN YOUNG LORDS GO ABOUT ALL THE GIRLS ARE CAUTIONED AS A MATTER OF COURSE	9.22
5287-39165-0092.flac	AND THEN AGAIN THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT AS MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT FEEL THAT SHE HAD ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY ON THE MATTER POISON SHOULD BE THE WORD WITH ANY ONE SO FATAL AS LORD LUFTON AND HE OUGHT TO BE MADE UP OF SOME PARTICULAR COLOUR	15.1
5287-39165-0093.flac	FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BE SWALLOWED IN MISTAKE YOU WILL BE SAFE YOU SEE SAID FANNY LAUGHING AS YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY CAUTIONED AS TO THIS INDIVIDUAL BOTTLE AH	10.555
5287-39165-0094.flac	AFTER I HAVE HAD SO MANY DOSES IT IS NO GOOD TELLING ME ABOUT IT NOW WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE	5.535
5287-39165-0095.flac	AND I REGARDED IT AS A MERE COMMONPLACE POWDER GOOD FOR THE COMPLEXION I WONDER WHETHER IT'S TOO LATE OR WHETHER THERE'S ANY ANTIDOTE MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT ALWAYS QUITE UNDERSTAND HER SISTER IN LAW AND NOW SHE WAS A LITTLE AT A LOSS	15.305
5287-39165-0096.flac	I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH HARM DONE YET ON EITHER SIDE SHE SAID CHEERILY AH YOU DON'T KNOW FANNY BUT I DO THINK THAT IF I DIE AS I SHALL I FEEL I SHALL AND IF SO I DO THINK IT OUGHT TO GO VERY HARD WITH LADY LUFTON	15.54
5287-39165-0097.flac	WHY DIDN'T SHE LABEL HIM DANGEROUS IN TIME AND THEN THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND UP TO THEIR OWN ROOMS IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO UNDERSTAND LUCY'S STATE OF MIND AT PRESENT AND IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT HERSELF	15.24
5287-39165-0098.flac	SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW IN HAVING BEEN THUS MADE THE SUBJECT OF REMARK WITH REFERENCE TO LORD LUFTON SHE KNEW THAT HER PLEASANT EVENINGS AT FRAMLEY COURT WERE NOW OVER AND THAT SHE COULD NOT AGAIN TALK TO HIM IN AN UNRESTRAINED TONE	15.95
5287-39165-0099.flac	AND WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT SHE HAD FELT THE AIR OF THE WHOLE PLACE TO BE VERY COLD BEFORE HER INTIMACY WITH HIM AND NOW IT MUST BE COLD AGAIN TWO HOMES HAD BEEN OPEN TO HER FRAMLEY COURT AND THE PARSONAGE	14.025
5287-39165-0100.flac	AND NOW AS FAR AS COMFORT WAS CONCERNED SHE MUST CONFINE HERSELF TO THE LATTER SHE COULD NOT AGAIN BE COMFORTABLE IN LADY LUFTON'S DRAWING ROOM BUT THEN SHE COULD NOT HELP ASKING HERSELF WHETHER LADY LUFTON WAS NOT RIGHT	14.275
5287-39165-0101.flac	SHE HAD HAD COURAGE ENOUGH AND PRESENCE OF MIND TO JOKE ABOUT THE MATTER WHEN HER SISTER IN LAW SPOKE TO HER AND YET SHE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT IT WAS NO JOKING MATTER LORD LUFTON HAD NOT ABSOLUTELY MADE LOVE TO HER BUT HE HAD LATTERLY SPOKEN TO HER IN A MANNER	16.055
5287-39165-0102.flac	WHICH SHE KNEW WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THAT ORDINARY COMFORTABLE MASCULINE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF WHICH SHE HAD ONCE SATISFIED HERSELF WAS NOT FANNY RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID THAT INTIMATE FRIENDSHIPS OF THAT NATURE WERE DANGEROUS THINGS	14.235
5287-39165-0103.flac	YES LUCY VERY DANGEROUS LUCY BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT HAD OWNED TO HERSELF THAT THEY WERE SO AND LYING THERE WITH SLEEPLESS EYES AND A MOIST PILLOW	12.155
5287-39165-0104.flac	SHE WAS DRIVEN TO CONFESS THAT THE LABEL WOULD IN TRUTH BE NOW TOO LATE THAT THE CAUTION HAD COME TO HER AFTER THE POISON HAD BEEN SWALLOWED WAS THERE ANY ANTIDOTE THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT FOR HER TO CONSIDER	13.345
6135-41994-0014.flac	HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE MURDERER HE PLAYED HIS PART PERFECTLY STILL I KNOW THAT HE DID PLAY A PART AND THAT IS SOMETHING	10.87
6135-41994-0015.flac	HE TALKED OF HIS FAMILY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN HENCE HE HAS NEITHER CHILDREN WIFE NOR FAMILY	7.075
6135-41994-0016.flac	WHAT KIND OF FELLOW WAS THIS DRUNKARD HE INQUIRED HE WAS TALL AND STOUT WITH FULL RUDDY CHEEKS A PAIR OF WHITE WHISKERS SMALL EYES A BROAD FLAT NOSE AND A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL MANNER	13.64
6135-41994-0017.flac	HOW OLD WOULD YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY DID YOU FORM ANY IDEA OF HIS PROFESSION IT'S MY OPINION THAT WHAT WITH HIS SOFT CAP AND HIS HEAVY BROWN OVERCOAT HE MUST BE EITHER A CLERK	14.815
6135-41994-0018.flac	OR THE KEEPER OF SOME LITTLE SHOP HAVING OBTAINED THIS DESCRIPTION	4.1
6135-41994-0019.flac	LECOQ WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE STATION HOUSE WHEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT BROUGHT HIM TO A STANDSTILL	5.17
6135-41994-0020.flac	HE EXCLAIMED THE KEEPER LAUGHED HEARTILY HOW COULD HE HAVE HAD ANY HE RESPONDED ISN'T THE OLD WOMAN ALONE IN HER CELL AH THE OLD WRETCH SHE HAS BEEN CURSING AND THREATENING EVER SINCE SHE ARRIVED	13.12
6135-41994-0021.flac	LECOQ'S GLANCE AND GESTURE WERE SO EXPRESSIVE OF IMPATIENCE AND WRATH THAT THE KEEPER PAUSED IN HIS RECITAL MUCH PERTURBED WHAT IS THE MATTER HE STAMMERED WHY ARE YOU ANGRY BECAUSE REPLIED LECOQ FURIOUSLY	16.295
6135-41994-0022.flac	NOT WISHING TO DISCLOSE THE REAL CAUSE OF HIS ANGER HE ENTERED THE STATION HOUSE SAYING THAT HE WANTED TO SEE THE PRISONER LEFT ALONE THE KEEPER BEGAN TO SWEAR IN HIS TURN THESE POLICE AGENTS ARE ALL ALIKE HE GRUMBLED THEY QUESTION YOU	15.51
6135-41994-0023.flac	YOU TELL THEM ALL THEY DESIRE TO KNOW AND AFTERWARD IF YOU VENTURE TO ASK THEM ANYTHING THEY REPLY NOTHING OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY IT MAKES THEM PROUD LOOKING THROUGH THE LITTLE LATTICED WINDOW IN THE DOOR	15.25
6135-41994-0024.flac	BY WHICH THE MEN ON GUARD WATCH THE PRISONERS LECOQ EAGERLY EXAMINED THE APPEARANCE OF THE ASSUMED MURDERER HE WAS OBLIGED TO ASK HIMSELF IF THIS WAS REALLY THE SAME MAN HE HAD SEEN SOME HOURS PREVIOUSLY AT THE POIVRIERE	14.15
6135-41994-0025.flac	STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE INNER DOOR AND HOLDING THE WHOLE SQUAD OF POLICE AGENTS IN CHECK BY THE INTENSE FURY OF HIS ATTITUDE NOW ON THE CONTRARY HE SEEMED AS IT WERE THE PERSONIFICATION OF WEAKNESS AND DESPONDENCY	15.9
6135-41994-0026.flac	HE WAS SEATED ON A BENCH OPPOSITE THE GRATING IN THE DOOR HIS ELBOWS RESTING ON HIS KNEES HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND	7.73
6135-41994-0027.flac	NO MURMURED LECOQ NO THIS MAN IS NOT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SO SAYING HE ENTERED THE CELL THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS HEAD GAVE THE DETECTIVE AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE BUT DID NOT UTTER A WORD WELL HOW GOES IT	15.21
6135-41994-0028.flac	ASKED LECOQ I AM INNOCENT RESPONDED THE PRISONER IN A HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICE I HOPE SO I AM SURE BUT THAT IS FOR THE MAGISTRATE TO DECIDE I CAME TO SEE IF YOU WANTED ANYTHING NO REPLIED THE MURDERER	14.855
6135-41994-0029.flac	BUT A SECOND LATER HE CHANGED HIS MIND ALL THE SAME HE SAID I SHOULDN'T MIND A CRUST AND A DRINK OF WINE	6.18
6135-41994-0030.flac	IN HIS OPINION IF THE MURDERER HAD ASKED FOR A DRINK AFTER AT FIRST REFUSING TO PARTAKE OF ANYTHING	5.535
6135-41994-0031.flac	AT ALL EVENTS WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE THE PRISONER ATE WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE	5.48
6135-41994-0032.flac	DRAINED IT SLOWLY AND REMARKED THAT'S CAPITAL THERE CAN BE NOTHING TO BEAT THAT	5.405
6135-41994-0033.flac	HOPING NAY ALMOST EXPECTING THAT THE MURDERER WOULD NOT DRINK IT WITHOUT SOME SIGN OF REPUGNANCE AND YET THE CONTRARY PROVED THE CASE HOWEVER THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD NO TIME TO PONDER OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCE	13.56
6135-41994-0034.flac	FOR A RUMBLE OF WHEELS NOW ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THAT LUGUBRIOUS VEHICLE THE BLACK MARIA WHEN THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS REMOVED FROM HER CELL	9.145
6135-41994-0035.flac	THAT SHE WAS AT LENGTH GOT INTO THE VAN THEN IT WAS THAT THE OFFICIALS TURNED TO THE ASSASSIN	5.695
6135-41994-0036.flac	THE CULPRIT ENTERED THE VEHICLE IN THE MOST UNCONCERNED MANNER AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS COMPARTMENT LIKE ONE ACCUSTOMED TO IT KNOWING THE MOST COMFORTABLE POSITION TO ASSUME IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS	11.095
6135-41995-0000.flac	LECOQ HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT IN FRONT BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND THE GUARD BUT HIS MIND WAS SO ENGROSSED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS THAT HE HEARD NOTHING OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH WAS VERY JOVIAL	10.4
6135-41995-0001.flac	WHO SANG AND YELLED HER IMPRECATIONS ALTERNATELY IT IS NEEDLESS HOWEVER TO RECAPITULATE HER OATHS LET US RATHER FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF LECOQ'S MEDITATION BY WHAT MEANS COULD HE SECURE SOME CLUE TO THE MURDERER'S IDENTITY	14.665
6135-41995-0002.flac	HE WAS STILL CONVINCED THAT THE PRISONER MUST BELONG	3.0899375
6135-41995-0003.flac	SUCH CONDUCT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE INDEED ALMOST PROBABLE ON THE PART OF A MAN ENDOWED WITH CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH OF WILL AND REALIZING THE IMMINENCE OF HIS PERIL BUT GRANTING THIS WOULD HE BE EQUALLY ABLE TO HIDE HIS FEELINGS	15.39
6135-41995-0004.flac	WHEN HE WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO THE HUMILIATING FORMALITIES THAT AWAITED HIM FORMALITIES WHICH IN CERTAIN CASES CAN AND MUST	8.755
6135-41995-0005.flac	HE FELT SURE THAT THE DISGRACEFUL POSITION IN WHICH THE PRISONER WOULD FIND HIMSELF WOULD CAUSE HIM TO REVOLT TO LOSE HIS SELF CONTROL TO UTTER SOME WORD THAT MIGHT GIVE THE DESIRED CLUE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE GLOOMY VEHICLE	14.32
6135-41995-0006.flac	HAD TURNED OFF THE PONT NEUF ON TO THE QUAI DE L'HORLOGE THAT THE YOUNG DETECTIVE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS TRANSPIRING AROUND HIM SOON THE VAN PASSED THROUGH AN OPEN GATEWAY AND DREW UP IN A SMALL DAMP COURTYARD	15.24
6135-41995-0007.flac	LECOQ IMMEDIATELY ALIGHTED AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE COMPARTMENT IN WHICH THE SUPPOSED MURDERER WAS CONFINED EXCLAIMING AS HE DID SO HERE WE ARE GET OUT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF THE PRISONER ESCAPING THE IRON GATE HAD BEEN CLOSED	15.635
6135-41995-0008.flac	AND AT LEAST A DOZEN AGENTS WERE STANDING NEAR AT HAND WAITING TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEW ARRIVALS THE PRISONER SLOWLY STEPPED TO THE GROUND HIS EXPRESSION OF FACE REMAINED UNCHANGED AND EACH GESTURE EVINCED THE PERFECT INDIFFERENCE	15.355
6135-41995-0009.flac	OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH ORDEALS LECOQ SCRUTINIZED HIS DEMEANOR AS ATTENTIVELY AS AN ANATOMIST MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ACTION OF A MUSCLE HE NOTED THAT THE PRISONER SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE A SENSATION OF SATISFACTION	14.705
6135-41995-0010.flac	AND THEN STRETCHED AND SHOOK HIMSELF AS IF TO REGAIN THE ELASTICITY OF HIS LIMBS CRAMPED BY CONFINEMENT IN THE NARROW COMPARTMENT FROM WHICH HE HAD JUST EMERGED THEN HE GLANCED AROUND HIM AND A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE PLAYED UPON HIS LIPS	16.27

6506-10073-0039.flac	I HAVE SACRIFICED NO GIRL TO MY REVENGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS THROWN ME OVER IN THE LITTLE TRANSACTIONS I HAVE HAD I HAVE ALWAYS RUN STRAIGHT	8.735
6506-10073-0040.flac	AND NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THE BUCKET OF CLARET JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID SIR FRANCIS THEN DICK ROSS LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT AWAY TO MAKE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS DEPARTURE AS WERE POSSIBLE TO HIM AND THE READERS OF THIS STORY SHALL SEE HIM AND HEAR HIM NO MORE	16.13
6506-10073-0041.flac	SIR FRANCIS WHEN HE WAS LEFT ALONE TOOK OUT MISS ALTIFIORLA'S LETTER AND READ IT AGAIN HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD ASSUME GRAND MANNERS IN HIS PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH WOMEN	9.62

6506-10073-0043.flac	WHAT MY ANSWER WOULD BE WHEN A WOMAN ATTEMPTS TO DECEIVE A MAN IN SUCH A MATTER SHE KNOWS BEFOREHAND THAT THE ATTEMPT WILL BE VAIN AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT I COULD SUCCEED WITH YOU BUT YET A FEELING OF SHAMEFACEDNESS WHAT SOME LADIES CONSIDER AS MODESTY	15.635
6506-10073-0044.flac	FORCED ME INTO TEMPORARY SILENCE WHAT COULD I WISH BETTER THAN TO BE LOVED BY SUCH A ONE AS YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS THE RANK WHICH GOES FOR MUCH WITH ME THEN THERE IS THE MONEY WHICH I ADMIT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING	12.34
6506-10073-0045.flac	THEN THERE ARE THE MANNERS AND THE PECULIAR STATION BEFORE THE WORLD WHICH IS QUITE SEPARATE FROM THE RANK TO ME THESE ALONE ARE IRRESISTIBLE SHALL I SAY TOO THAT PERSONAL APPEARANCE DOES COUNT FOR MUCH I CAN FANCY MYSELF MARRYING AN UGLY MAN	15.365
6506-10073-0046.flac	BUT I CAN FANCY ALSO THAT I COULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT SOMETHING OF DISGUST MISS ALTIFIORLA WHEN SHE WROTE THIS HAD UNDERSTOOD WELL THAT VANITY AND LOVE OF FLATTERY WERE CONSPICUOUS TRAITS IN THE CHARACTER OF HER ADMIRER HAVING OWNED SO MUCH	15.07
6506-10073-0047.flac	WHAT IS THERE MORE TO SAY THAN THAT I AM THE HAPPIEST WOMAN BETWEEN THE SEAS THE READER MUST BE HERE TOLD THAT THIS LETTER HAD BEEN COPIED OUT A SECOND TIME BECAUSE IN THE FIRST COPY SHE HAD ALLOWED THE WORD GIRL TO PASS IN THE ABOVE SENTENCE SOMETHING TOLD HER	15.1

6506-10073-0049.flac	I DID REGARD HER AS THE MOST FORTUNATE GIRL BUT I DID NOT REGARD YOU AS THE HAPPIEST OF MEN	5.03
6506-10073-0050.flac	WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THERE IS AN ASPERITY RATHER THAN STRICTNESS ABOUT HER WHICH I KNEW YOUR SPIRIT WOULD NOT BROOK SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE THE BATTLINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE ARISEN WITH AN EQUAL TEMPER SHE CAN INDEED BEAR ALL THINGS WITH EQUANIMITY AS SHE DOES HER PRESENT POSITION BUT YOU	16.305

6506-73020-0009.flac	AND HIS SPEECH HARDLY BETRAYED THAT HE WAS NOT ENGLISH HARRY KNOWING THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER NOTICED NOW AND AGAIN SOME LITTLE ACQUIRED DISTINCTNESS OF SPEECH WHICH IS HARDLY NATURAL TO A NATIVE BUT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS TONGUE TO BETRAY HIM	14.53
6506-73020-0010.flac	SHAKING HANDS WITH HARRY CLAVERING DECLARED THAT HE HAD INCURRED NO TROUBLE AND DECLARED ALSO THAT HE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY TROUBLE IN OBEYING A BEHEST FROM HIS FRIEND LADY ONGAR HAD HE BEEN A POLE AS WAS THE COUNT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN TO ADD	15.465
6506-73020-0011.flac	BUT BEING SIMPLY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN HE WAS MUCH TOO AWKWARD FOR ANY SUCH COURTESY AS THAT THE COUNT OBSERVED THE OMISSION SMILED AND BOWED	9.795

6506-73020-0018.flac	BETTER THAN HE KNEW IT HIMSELF SLOWLY THE COUNT ATE HIS DINNER ENJOYING EVERY MORSEL THAT HE TOOK WITH THAT THOUGHTFUL CONSCIOUS PLEASURE WHICH YOUNG MEN NEVER ATTAIN IN EATING AND DRINKING AND WHICH MEN AS THEY GROW OLDER SO OFTEN FORGET TO ACQUIRE	15.58
6506-73020-0019.flac	BUT THE COUNT NEVER FORGOT ANY OF HIS OWN CAPACITIES FOR PLEASURE AND IN ALL THINGS MADE THE MOST OF HIS OWN RESOURCES TO BE RICH IS NOT TO HAVE ONE OR TEN THOUSAND A YEAR BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE OR TEN THOUSAND	14.54

6506-73020-0034.flac	HARRY WAS SHARP ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT ANY ASSERTION MADE UNDER SUCH A STIPULATION WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING IT WAS AS WHEN A MAN IN DENYING THE TRUTH OF A STATEMENT DOES SO WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT ON THAT SUBJECT	11.855
6506-73020-0035.flac	HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING ANY NUMBER OF LIES I DID NOT WRITE THE BOOK	5.66

8148-3956-0047.flac	ONE REASON WHY GENJI WAS SO MUCH ATTRACTED BY HER WAS THAT SHE GREATLY RESEMBLED A CERTAIN LADY IN THE PALACE TO WHOM HE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN FONDLY ATTACHED THE NUN STROKED THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR OF THE CHILD AND MURMURED TO HERSELF	15.11
8148-3956-0048.flac	HOW SPLENDID IT LOOKS WOULD THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS STRIVE TO KEEP IT THUS HER EXTREME YOUTH MAKES ME ANXIOUS HOWEVER HER MOTHER DEPARTED THIS LIFE WHEN SHE ONLY A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE WAS QUITE SENSIBLE AT THE AGE OF THIS ONE	16.89

8148-3956-0071.flac	THE LITTLE ONE IS HER DAUGHTER AND NO WONDER THAT SHE RESEMBLES THE ONE IN THE PALACE	5.135
8148-3956-0072.flac	HOW WOULD IT BE IF I HAD FREE CONTROL OVER HER AND HAD HER BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED ACCORDING TO MY OWN NOTIONS SO THINKING HE PROCEEDED TO SAY HOW SAD IT WAS THAT SHE DIED DID SHE LEAVE ANY OFFSPRING SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD AT HER DEATH	16.58

8148-3956-0089.flac	THIS AT LENGTH OBLIGED THE NUN TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCE HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE CALLED BUDDHA TO WITNESS THAT THOUGH HIS CONDUCT MAY HAVE SEEMED BOLD IT WAS DICTATED BY PURE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MOTIVES	14.63

8765-295000-0029.flac	MAKING AS SMOOTH A SURFACE AS POSSIBLE AND FINISHED THE POLISHING PROCESS WITH HIS FINGERS RUBBING AWAY UNTIL HE HAD OBTAINED AS TRANSPARENT A LENS AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE OF MAGNIFICENT CRYSTAL THE SUN WAS SHINING BRILLIANTLY ENOUGH FOR THE DOCTOR'S EXPERIMENT	15.555

8765-295000-0046.flac	AND THE QUESTION OF LIFE OR DEATH WOULD BE DECIDED BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER AT LAST ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALTAMONT STARTED UP WITH A SHOUT THAT ARRESTED THE WHOLE PARTY	12.28
8765-295000-0047.flac	AND POINTING TO A WHITE MASS THAT NO EYE BUT HIS COULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SURROUNDING ICEBERGS EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD RINGING VOICE	7.8
8765-295003-0000.flac	CHAPTER EIGHT AN EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF VICTORIA BAY NEXT MORNING CLAWBONNY WAS OUT BY DAWN OF DAY CLAMBERING UP THE STEEP ROCKY WALL AGAINST WHICH THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE LEANED	12.465
8765-295003-0001.flac	HE SUCCEEDED THOUGH WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE TOP WHICH HE FOUND TERMINATED ABRUPTLY IN A SORT OF TRUNCATED CONE	7.595
8765-295003-0002.flac	FROM THIS ELEVATION THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE VIEW OVER A VAST TRACT OF COUNTRY WHICH WAS ALL DISORDERED AND CONVULSED AS IF IT HAD UNDERGONE SOME VOLCANIC COMMOTION	9.695
8765-295003-0003.flac	WERE COVERED WITH A SHEET OF ICE A NEW PROJECT STRUCK THE DOCTOR'S MIND WHICH WAS SOON MATURED AND RIPE FOR EXECUTION HE LOST NO TIME IN GOING BACK TO THE SNOW HOUSE AND CONSULTING OVER IT WITH HIS COMPANIONS I HAVE GOT AN IDEA HE SAID	14.425
8765-295003-0004.flac	I THINK OF CONSTRUCTING A LIGHTHOUSE ON THE TOP OF THAT CONE ABOVE OUR HEADS A LIGHTHOUSE THEY ALL EXCLAIMED YES A LIGHTHOUSE	8.065
8765-295003-0005.flac	AND ALSO SERVE TO ILLUMINE OUR PLATEAU IN THE LONG DREARY WINTER MONTHS THERE IS NO DOUBT REPLIED ALTAMONT OF ITS UTILITY BUT HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT	9.365
8765-295003-0006.flac	NO SEAL OIL WOULD NOT GIVE NEARLY SUFFICIENT LIGHT IT WOULD SCARCELY BE VISIBLE THROUGH THE FOG ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO MAKE GAS OUT OF OUR COAL THEN NO NOT THAT EITHER FOR GAS WOULD NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH AND WORSE STILL IT WOULD WASTE OUR COMBUSTIBLES	14.485
8765-295003-0007.flac	WELL REPLIED ALTAMONT I'M AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW YOU OH I'M PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING AFTER THE MERCURY BULLET AND THE ICE LENS AND FORT PROVIDENCE I BELIEVE MISTER CLAWBONNY CAN DO ANYTHING EXCLAIMED JOHNSON	12.8099375
8765-295003-0008.flac	COME CLAWBONNY TELL US WHAT YOUR LIGHT IS TO BE THEN SAID ALTAMONT THAT'S SOON TOLD REPLIED CLAWBONNY I MEAN TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT YES WHY NOT HAVEN'T YOU A GALVANIC BATTERY ON BOARD YOUR SHIP YES	15.7800625
8765-295003-0009.flac	WELL THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY THEN IN PRODUCING AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THAT WILL COST NOTHING AND BE FAR BRIGHTER FIRST RATE SAID JOHNSON LET US SET TO WORK AT ONCE BY ALL MEANS	10.29
8765-295003-0010.flac	THERE IS PLENTY OF MATERIAL IN AN HOUR WE CAN RAISE A PILLAR OF ICE TEN FEET HIGH AND THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH AWAY WENT THE DOCTOR FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS AND THE COLUMN WAS SOON ERECTED AND CROWNED WITH A SHIP LANTERN	11.87
8765-295003-0011.flac	THE CONDUCTING WIRES WERE PROPERLY ADJUSTED WITHIN IT AND THE PILE WITH WHICH THEY COMMUNICATED FIXED UP IN THE SITTING ROOM WHERE THE WARMTH OF THE STOVE WOULD PROTECT IT FROM THE ACTION OF THE FROST AS SOON AS IT GREW DARK THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE AND PROVED A COMPLETE SUCCESS	14.435
8765-295003-0012.flac	AN INTENSE BRILLIANT LIGHT STREAMED FROM THE LANTERN AND ILLUMINED THE ENTIRE PLATEAU AND THE PLAINS BENEATH JOHNSON COULD NOT HELP CLAPPING HIS HANDS HALF BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT WELL I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY HE EXCLAIMED YOU'RE OUR SUN NOW	15.77
8765-295003-0013.flac	ONE MUST BE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WAS CLAWBONNY'S MODEST REPLY	4.3
8765-295003-0014.flac	A REGULAR COURSE OF LIFE COMMENCED NOW THOUGH UNCERTAIN WEATHER AND FREQUENT CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE MADE IT SOMETIMES IMPRACTICABLE TO VENTURE OUTSIDE THE HUT AT ALL	9.145
8765-295003-0015.flac	THEY STARTED VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING EACH ARMED WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN AND PLENTY OF POWDER AND SHOT	6.365
8765-295003-0016.flac	AND THE BRIGHT RAYS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT DID DUTY FOR THE GLORIOUS ORB OF DAY	4.28
8765-295003-0017.flac	FOR THE LIGHT WAS EQUAL TO THREE THOUSAND CANDLES OR THREE HUNDRED GAS BURNERS IT WAS INTENSELY COLD BUT DRY AND THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO WIND THE HUNTERS SET OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF CAPE WASHINGTON	12.695
8765-295003-0018.flac	AND THE HARD SNOW SO FAVOURED THEIR MARCH THAT IN THREE HOURS THEY HAD GONE FIFTEEN MILES DUK JUMPING AND BARKING BESIDE THEM ALL THE WAY	8.03
8765-295003-0019.flac	BUT FOUND NO TRACE OF HUMAN HABITATION AND INDEED SCARCELY A SIGN OF ANIMAL LIFE A FEW SNOW BIRDS HOWEVER DARTING TO AND FRO ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF SPRING AND THE RETURN OF THE ANIMAL CREATION THE SEA WAS STILL ENTIRELY FROZEN OVER	15.685
8765-295003-0020.flac	BUT IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE OPEN BREATHING HOLES IN THE ICE THAT THE SEALS HAD BEEN QUITE RECENTLY ON THE SURFACE IN ONE PART THE HOLES WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT THE DOCTOR SAID TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT WHEN SUMMER CAME THEY WOULD BE SEEN	13.725
8765-295003-0021.flac	THERE IN HUNDREDS AND WOULD BE EASILY CAPTURED FOR ON UNFREQUENTED SHORES THEY WERE NOT SO DIFFICULT OF APPROACH BUT ONCE FRIGHTEN THEM AND THEY ALL VANISH AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT AND NEVER RETURN TO THE SPOT AGAIN	12.88
8765-295003-0022.flac	INEXPERIENCED HUNTERS HE SAID HAVE OFTEN LOST A WHOLE SHOAL BY ATTACKING THEM EN MASSE WITH NOISY SHOUTS INSTEAD OF SINGLY AND SILENTLY IS IT FOR THE OIL OR SKIN THAT THEY ARE MOSTLY HUNTED EUROPEANS HUNT THEM FOR THE SKIN	14.01
8765-295003-0023.flac	THEY LIVE ON SEALS AND NOTHING IS SO DELICIOUS TO THEM AS A PIECE OF THE FLESH DIPPED IN THE BLOOD AND OIL	6.14
8765-295003-0024.flac	AND I'LL BET YOU SOMETHING I COULD DRESS YOU CUTLETS YOU WOULD NOT TURN UP YOUR NOSE AT UNLESS FOR THEIR BLACK APPEARANCE WE'LL SET YOU TO WORK ON IT SAID BELL AND I'LL EAT AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE TO PLEASE YOU MY GOOD BELL	11.745
8765-295003-0025.flac	YOU MEAN TO SAY TO PLEASE YOURSELF BUT YOUR VORACITY WOULD NEVER EQUAL THE GREEN LANDERS FOR THEY DEVOUR FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN POUNDS OF MEAT A DAY FIFTEEN POUNDS SAID BELL WHAT STOMACHS ARCTIC STOMACHS REPLIED THE DOCTOR ARE PRODIGIOUS	14.94
8765-295003-0026.flac	THEY CAN EXPAND AT WILL AND I MAY ADD CONTRACT AT WILL SO THAT THEY CAN ENDURE STARVATION QUITE AS WELL AS ABUNDANCE WHEN AN ESQUIMAUX SITS DOWN TO DINNER HE IS QUITE THIN AND BY THE TIME HE HAS FINISHED HE IS SO CORPULENT YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIM	15.205
8765-295003-0027.flac	BUT THEN WE MUST REMEMBER THAT ONE MEAL SOMETIMES HAS TO LAST A WHOLE DAY THIS VORACITY MUST BE PECULIAR TO THE INHABITANTS OF COLD COUNTRIES SAID ALTAMONT I THINK IT IS REPLIED THE DOCTOR IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS PEOPLE MUST EAT ENORMOUSLY	14.9
8765-295003-0028.flac	IT IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH BUT OF EXISTENCE	3.665
8765-295003-0029.flac	INVIGORATING REGIMEN CERTAINLY SAID BELL NOT SO MUCH AS YOU IMAGINE MY FRIEND AN INDIAN WHO GUZZLES LIKE THAT CAN'T DO A WHIT BETTER DAY'S WORK THAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HAS HIS POUND OF BEEF AND PINT OF BEER THINGS ARE BEST AS THEY ARE THEN MISTER CLAWBONNY	16.05
8765-295003-0030.flac	NO DOUBT OF IT AND YET AN ESQUIMAUX MEAL MAY WELL ASTONISH US IN SIR JOHN ROSS'S NARRATIVE HE STATES HIS SURPRISE AT THE APPETITES OF HIS GUIDES HE TELLS US THAT TWO OF THEM JUST TWO MIND	13.855
8765-295003-0031.flac	DEVOURED A QUARTER OF A BUFFALO IN ONE MORNING THEY CUT THE MEAT IN LONG NARROW STRIPS AND THE MODE OF EATING WAS EITHER FOR THE ONE TO BITE OFF AS MUCH AS HIS MOUTH COULD HOLD AND THEN PASS IT ON TO THE OTHER	12.86
8765-295003-0032.flac	OR TO LEAVE THE LONG RIBBONS OF MEAT DANGLING FROM THE MOUTH AND DEVOUR THEM GRADUALLY LIKE BOA CONSTRICTORS	6.405
8765-295003-0033.flac	EVERY MAN HAS HIS OWN FASHION OF DINING REMARKED THE PHILOSOPHICAL AMERICAN HAPPILY SAID THE DOCTOR WELL IF EATING IS SUCH AN IMPERATIVE NECESSITY IN THESE LATITUDES	11.07
8765-295003-0034.flac	IT QUITE ACCOUNTS FOR ALL THE JOURNALS OF ARCTIC TRAVELLERS BEING SO FULL OF EATING AND DRINKING YOU ARE RIGHT RETURNED THE DOCTOR I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE SAME FACT BUT I THINK IT ARISES NOT ONLY FROM THE NECESSITY OF FULL DIET BUT FROM THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY	15.005
8765-295003-0035.flac	SOMETIMES IN PROCURING IT THE THOUGHT OF FOOD IS ALWAYS UPPERMOST IN THE MIND AND NATURALLY FINDS MENTION IN THE NARRATIVE AND YET SAID ALTAMONT IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT IN THE COLDEST PARTS OF NORWAY THE PEASANTS DO NOT SEEM TO NEED SUCH SUBSTANTIAL FARE	15.675
8765-295003-0036.flac	MILK DIET IS THEIR STAPLE FOOD WITH EGGS AND BREAD MADE OF THE BARK OF THE BIRCH TREE A LITTLE SALMON OCCASIONALLY BUT NEVER MEAT AND STILL THEY ARE FINE HARDY FELLOWS IT IS AN AFFAIR OF ORGANIZATION OUT OF MY POWER TO EXPLAIN	14.8
8765-295003-0037.flac	REPLIED CLAWBONNY BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF THESE SAME NORWEGIANS WERE TRANSPLANTED TO GREENLAND	6.085
8765-295003-0038.flac	EVEN IF WE OURSELVES WERE TO REMAIN IN THIS BLESSED COUNTRY LONG WE SHOULD BE AS BAD AS THE ESQUIMAUX EVEN IF WE ESCAPED BECOMING REGULAR GLUTTONS I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY YOU MAKE ME FEEL HUNGRY WITH TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT EATING EXCLAIMED BELL	14.35
8765-295003-0039.flac	NOT I SAID ALTAMONT IT RATHER SICKENS ME AND MAKES ME LOATHE THE SIGHT OF A SEAL BUT STOP I DO BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF A DINNER OFF ONE FOR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ALIVE LYING ON THOSE LUMPS OF ICE YONDER	15.055
8765-295003-0040.flac	IT IS A WALRUS EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR BE QUIET AND LET US GET UP TO HIM CLAWBONNY WAS RIGHT IT WAS A WALRUS OF HUGE DIMENSIONS DISPORTING HIMSELF NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY	13.02
8765-295003-0041.flac	THE HUNTERS SEPARATED GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO AS TO SURROUND THE ANIMAL AND CUT OFF ALL RETREAT THEY CREPT ALONG CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND THE HUMMOCKS	8.73
8765-295003-0042.flac	AND SOON LAY DEAD REDDENING THE ICE FIELD WITH HIS BLOOD IT WAS A FINE ANIMAL MEASURING MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN LENGTH	7.99
8765-295003-0043.flac	BUT THE HUNTERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH CUTTING OFF THE MOST SAVOURY PARTS AND LEFT THE REST TO THE RAVENS WHICH HAD JUST BEGUN TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE	8.395
8765-295003-0044.flac	THE MOON HAD NOT YET RISEN BUT THE SKY WAS SERENE AND CLOUDLESS AND ALREADY GLITTERING WITH STARS MAGNIFICENT STARS COME SAID THE DOCTOR LET US BE OFF FOR IT IS GETTING LATE	11.265
8765-295003-0045.flac	LET US GO THE SHORTEST ROAD HOWEVER AND GET QUICKLY HOME WITHOUT LOSING OUR WAY THE STARS WILL GUIDE US THEY RESOLVED TO TRY A MORE DIRECT ROUTE BACK BY GOING FURTHER INLAND AND AVOIDING THE WINDINGS OF THE COAST	12.51
8765-295003-0046.flac	THE QUESTION WAS RAISED WHETHER TO CONSTRUCT A HUT AND REST TILL MORNING OR PROCEED BUT CLAWBONNY INSISTED ON GOING ON AS HATTERAS AND JOHNSON WOULD BE SO UNEASY DUK WILL GUIDE US HE SAID HE WON'T GO WRONG	13.64
8765-295003-0047.flac	HIS INSTINCT CAN DISPENSE WITH STAR AND COMPASS JUST LET US KEEP CLOSE BEHIND HIM	5.435
8765-295009-0000.flac	THE PRISONERS WERE FREE AND THEIR JOY FOUND VENT IN THE NOISIEST DEMONSTRATIONS THEY EMPLOYED THE REST OF THE DAY IN REPAIRING THE HOUSE WHICH HAD SUFFERED GREATLY BY THE EXPLOSION THEY CLEARED AWAY THE BLOCKS PILED UP BY THE ANIMALS	14.445
8765-295009-0001.flac	AND FILLED UP THE RENTS IN THE WALLS WORKING WITH MIGHT AND MAIN ENLIVENED BY THE MANY SONGS OF OLD JOHNSON NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A SINGULAR RISE IN THE TEMPERATURE	10.125
8765-295009-0002.flac	AND SYMPTOMS OF A THAW APPEARED THE ICE BEGAN TO CRACK HERE AND THERE AND JETS OF SALT WATER WERE THROWN UP LIKE FOUNTAINS IN AN ENGLISH PARK	8.395
8765-295009-0003.flac	A FEW DAYS LATER THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS THICK VAPOUR ROSE FROM THE SNOW GIVING PROMISE OF THE SPEEDY DISAPPEARANCE OF THESE IMMENSE MASSES THE SUN'S PALE DISC BECAME DEEPER IN COLOUR AND REMAINED LONGER ABOVE THE HORIZON	14.005
8765-295009-0004.flac	THE BIRDS WERE RETURNING IN FLOCKS AND THE AIR RESOUNDED WITH THEIR DEAFENING CRIES	5.38
8765-295009-0005.flac	THAT ALMOST ALL THESE ANIMALS WERE BEGINNING TO LOSE THEIR WHITE WINTER DRESS AND WOULD SOON PUT ON SUMMER ATTIRE WHILE NATURE WAS ALREADY PROVIDING MOSSES AND POPPIES	9.655
8765-295009-0006.flac	BUT WITH THESE INOFFENSIVE ANIMALS CAME BACK THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES FOXES AND WOLVES ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF THEIR PREY AND DISMAL HOWLS BROKE THE SILENCE OF THE SHORT NIGHT ARCTIC WOLVES CLOSELY RESEMBLE DOGS	13.3
8765-295009-0007.flac	AND THEIR BARKING WOULD DECEIVE THE MOST PRACTISED EARS EVEN THE CANINE RACE THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY IT INDEED IT SEEMS AS IF THE WILY ANIMALS EMPLOYED THIS RUSE TO ATTRACT THE DOGS AND MAKE THEM THEIR PREY	13.495
8765-295009-0008.flac	SEVERAL NAVIGATORS HAVE MENTIONED THE FACT AND THE DOCTOR'S OWN EXPERIENCE CONFIRMED IT JOHNSON TOOK CARE NOT TO LET HIS GREENLANDERS LOOSE OF DUK THERE WAS LITTLE FEAR NOTHING COULD TAKE HIM IN FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT	14.05
8765-295009-0009.flac	HUNTING WAS THE PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION THERE WAS AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF FRESH MEAT TO BE HAD THEY SHOT PARTRIDGES PTARMIGANS AND SNOW ORTOLANS WHICH ARE DELICIOUS EATING THE HUNTERS NEVER WENT FAR FROM FORT PROVIDENCE	13.335
8765-295009-0010.flac	FOR GAME WAS SO PLENTIFUL THAT IT SEEMED WAITING THEIR GUNS AND THE WHOLE BAY PRESENTED AN ANIMATED APPEARANCE THE THAW MEANWHILE WAS MAKING RAPID PROGRESS	10.24
8765-295009-0011.flac	AND THE WATER RAN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES IN CATARACTS AND DASHED IN TORRENTS THROUGH THE RAVINES THE DOCTOR LOST NO TIME IN CLEARING ABOUT AN ACRE OF GROUND IN WHICH HE SOWED THE SEEDS OF ANTI SCORBUTIC PLANTS	12.48
8765-295009-0012.flac	WHEN THE COLD RETURNED IN FULL FORCE	2.4
8765-295009-0013.flac	EVERYTHING WAS FROZEN BIRDS QUADRUPEDS AMPHIBIA DISAPPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC SEAL HOLES RECLOSED AND THE ICE ONCE MORE BECAME HARD AS GRANITE THE CHANGE WAS MOST STRIKING	13.405
8765-295009-0014.flac	IT OCCURRED ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF MAY DURING THE NIGHT THE DOCTOR WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HAVING ALL HIS WORK TO DO AGAIN BUT HATTERAS BORE THE GRIEVANCE MOST UNPHILOSOPHICALLY	9.985
8765-295009-0015.flac	NO MY FRIEND I DON'T IT IS A LAST BLOW FROM THE COLD YOU SEE THESE ARE HIS DOMINIONS AND HE WON'T BE DRIVEN OUT WITHOUT MAKING SOME RESISTANCE HE CAN DEFEND HIMSELF PRETTY WELL SAID BELL RUBBING HIS FACE YES BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED	15.625
8765-295009-0016.flac	AND NOT HAVE WASTED MY SEED LIKE AN IGNORAMUS	3.155
8765-295009-0017.flac	BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY ASKED ALTAMONT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF COURSE AND WITHOUT BEING A WIZARD	7.725
8765-295009-0018.flac	AND THE OTHER TWO SAINTS WHOSE FETE DAYS FALL THIS MONTH ABSURD PRAY TELL ME WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH IT WHAT INFLUENCE CAN THEY POSSIBLY HAVE ON THE TEMPERATURE	10.69
8765-295009-0019.flac	AN IMMENSE ONE IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE HORTICULTURISTS WHO CALL THEM THE PATRON SAINTS OF THE FROST AND FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE GENERALLY THERE IS A PERIODICAL FROST IN THE MONTH OF MAY AND IT IS COLDEST FROM THE ELEVENTH TO THE THIRTEENTH	15.14
8765-295009-0020.flac	THAT IS THE FACT AND HOW IS IT EXPLAINED IN TWO WAYS SOME SAY THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF ASTEROIDS COME BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR	11.015
8765-295009-0021.flac	AND OTHERS THAT THE MERE MELTING OF THE SNOW NECESSARILY ABSORBS A LARGE AMOUNT OF HEAT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURE BOTH THEORIES ARE PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH BUT THE FACT REMAINS WHICHEVER WE ACCEPT	11.88
8765-295009-0022.flac	THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT FOR THE COLD LASTED TILL THE END OF THE MONTH AND PUT AN END TO ALL THEIR HUNTING EXPEDITIONS	6.645
8765-295009-0023.flac	THIS WAS VIOLENT QUINSY BUT UNDER THE DOCTOR'S SKILFUL TREATMENT IT WAS SOON CURED ICE WAS THE ONLY REMEDY HE EMPLOYED ADMINISTERED IN SMALL PIECES	10.64
8765-295009-0024.flac	CLAWBONNY DETERMINED TO HAVE A TALK WITH THE CAPTAIN ON AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT THE BUILDING OF A SLOOP OUT OF THE PLANKS OF THE PORPOISE THE DOCTOR HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN AS HATTERAS HAD DECLARED SO VEHEMENTLY THAT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO USE A MORSEL OF AMERICAN WOOD	15.455
8765-295009-0025.flac	YET IT WAS HIGH TIME HE WERE BROUGHT TO REASON AS JUNE WAS AT HAND THE ONLY SEASON FOR DISTANT EXPEDITIONS AND THEY COULD NOT START WITHOUT A SHIP HE THOUGHT OVER IT A LONG WHILE AND AT LAST DREW THE CAPTAIN ASIDE AND SAID IN THE KINDEST GENTLEST WAY	15.84
8765-295009-0026.flac	MOST CERTAINLY I DO REPLIED THE CAPTAIN EARNESTLY MY BEST INDEED MY ONLY FRIEND AND IF I GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE WITHOUT YOUR ASKING WILL YOU CONSIDER MY MOTIVE IS PERFECTLY DISINTERESTED	14.335
8765-295009-0027.flac	YES FOR I KNOW YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ACTUATED BY SELF INTEREST BUT WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT	6.01
8765-295009-0028.flac	DO YOU LOOK ON ME AS A TRUE HEARTED ENGLISHMAN LIKE YOURSELF ANXIOUS FOR HIS COUNTRY'S GLORY HATTERAS LOOKED SURPRISED BUT SIMPLY SAID I DO	10.425
8765-295009-0029.flac	AND I UNDERSTAND AND SHARE YOUR AMBITION BUT TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECT YOU MUST EMPLOY THE RIGHT MEANS WELL AND HAVE I NOT SACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR IT NO HATTERAS YOU HAVE NOT SACRIFICED YOUR PERSONAL ANTIPATHIES	14.445
8765-295009-0030.flac	AH IT IS THE BOAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT MAN HATTERAS LET US DISCUSS THE QUESTION CALMLY AND EXAMINE THE CASE ON ALL SIDES THE COAST ON WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES AT PRESENT MAY TERMINATE ABRUPTLY	15.035
8765-295009-0031.flac	WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT IT STRETCHES RIGHT AWAY TO THE POLE INDEED IF YOUR PRESENT INFORMATION PROVE CORRECT WE OUGHT TO COME TO AN OPEN SEA DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WELL SUPPOSING WE REACH THIS ARCTIC OCEAN AND FIND IT FREE FROM ICE AND EASY TO NAVIGATE	15.82
8765-295009-0032.flac	WHAT SHALL WE DO IF WE HAVE NO SHIP HATTERAS MADE NO REPLY TELL ME NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO FIND YOURSELF ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE POLE AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO IT HATTERAS STILL SAID NOTHING BUT BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS	15.425
8765-295009-0033.flac	BESIDES CONTINUED THE DOCTOR LOOK AT THE QUESTION IN ITS MORAL ASPECT HERE IS AN ENGLISHMAN WHO SACRIFICES HIS FORTUNE AND EVEN HIS LIFE TO WIN FRESH GLORY FOR HIS COUNTRY	11.4799375
8765-295009-0034.flac	BUT BECAUSE THE BOAT WHICH BEARS HIM ACROSS AN UNKNOWN OCEAN OR TOUCHES THE NEW SHORE HAPPENS TO BE MADE OF THE PLANKS OF AN AMERICAN VESSEL A CAST AWAY WRECK OF NO USE TO ANYONE WILL THAT LESSEN THE HONOUR OF THE DISCOVERY	14.2200625
8765-295009-0035.flac	AND MUST NOT A SLOOP BUILT BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN AND MANNED BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN BE ENGLISH FROM KEEL TO GUNWALE HATTERAS WAS STILL SILENT NO CONTINUED CLAWBONNY THE REAL TRUTH IS IT IS NOT THE SLOOP YOU CARE ABOUT IT IS THE MAN	16.615
8765-295009-0036.flac	I HATE HIM WITH A THOROUGH ENGLISH HATRED FATE HAS THROWN HIM IN MY PATH TO SAVE YOU TO RUIN ME HE SEEMS TO DEFY ME AND SPEAKS AS IF HE WERE LORD AND MASTER	12.335
8765-295009-0037.flac	HE THINKS HE HAS MY DESTINY IN HIS HANDS AND KNOWS ALL MY PROJECTS DIDN'T WE SEE THE MAN IN HIS TRUE COLOURS WHEN WE WERE GIVING NAMES TO THE DIFFERENT COASTS HAS HE EVER AVOWED HIS OBJECT IN COMING SO FAR NORTH	12.1
8765-295009-0038.flac	WELL HATTERAS SUPPOSE IT IS SO DOES IT FOLLOW THAT THIS EXPEDITION IS TO SEARCH FOR THE NORTH POLE MAY IT NOT BE TO FIND THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BUT ANYWAY	9.985
8765-295009-0039.flac	ALTAMONT IS IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF OUR OBJECT FOR NEITHER JOHNSON NOR BELL NOR MYSELF HAVE EVER BREATHED A WORD TO HIM ABOUT IT AND I AM SURE YOU HAVE NOT WELL LET HIM ALWAYS REMAIN SO HE MUST BE TOLD IN THE END FOR WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM HERE ALONE WHY NOT	16.665
8765-295009-0040.flac	CAN'T HE STAY HERE IN FORT PROVIDENCE HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THAT HATTERAS AND MOREOVER TO LEAVE A MAN IN THAT WAY AND NOT KNOW WHETHER WE MIGHT FIND HIM SAFE WHEN WE CAME BACK WOULD BE WORSE THAN IMPRUDENT IT WOULD BE INHUMAN ALTAMONT WILL COME WITH US	15.715
8765-295009-0041.flac	HE MUST COME BUT WE NEED NOT DISCLOSE OUR PROJECTS LET US TELL HIM NOTHING BUT SIMPLY BUILD A SLOOP FOR THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF MAKING A SURVEY OF THE COAST HATTERAS COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONSENT BUT SAID	15.775
8765-295009-0042.flac	AND SUPPOSE THE MAN WON'T ALLOW HIS SHIP TO BE CUT UP IN THAT CASE YOU MUST TAKE THE LAW IN YOUR OWN HANDS AND BUILD A VESSEL IN SPITE OF HIM I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD REFUSE THEN HE MUST BE ASKED BEFORE HE CAN REFUSE	15.335
8765-295009-0043.flac	HE KEPT HIS WORD FOR THAT VERY SAME NIGHT AT SUPPER HE MANAGED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION TOWARDS THE SUBJECT OF MAKING EXCURSIONS DURING SUMMER FOR HYDROGRAPHICAL PURPOSES YOU WILL JOIN US I SUPPOSE ALTAMONT HE SAID OF COURSE REPLIED THE AMERICAN	15.515
